The wedding, held at Singhola, was an elaborate affair with fireworks and bhangra dancers entertaining guests.

Yogeshwar Dutt had also gone live on Facebook with a video of his friends celebrating on the night before his wedding.

A two-time Asian Games medallist, Yogeshwar Dutt chose to take only a token Re 1 from his bride’s family ahead of his marriage.

“I saw my family struggle to collect dowry for the girls of the family,” Yogeshwar had said. “As a result, I decided on two things while growing up -- I will excel in wrestling and I will not accept dowry.”
