“India is not seeking NSG membership as a gift. We are seeking it based on our non-proliferation record,” said MEA. “India is not seeking NSG membership as a gift. We are seeking it based on our non-proliferation record,” said MEA.

Nearly two days after China had said that admission of non-NPT signatories in NSG cannot be a “farewell gift” for countries to give to each other, India on Thursday it’s not seeking NSG membership as a gift. Speaking to the media, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup clarified, “India is not seeking NSG membership as a gift. We are seeking it based on our non-proliferation record.”

New Delhi’s comments come after China said they have made their position clear before and it won’t be some kind of a farewell gift for countries to give to each other.

I just want to point out that NSG membership shall not be some kind of (a) farewell gift for countries to give to each other.”

When asked on reports of the British Parliament debating Jammu and Kashmir issue, Swarup said there’s no room for a third party role.
