On a day when large crowds gathered in Tamil Nadu demanding a permanent lift on Jallikattu ban, Ice House Police Station near Marina Beach in Chennai was set on fire by the agitated mob. The police tried to disperse the protesters as the situation in the state continued to turn violent. The bull fighting sport was organised on Sunday in some parts of the state after a special ordinance was passed on Saturday which made a Tamil Nadu-specific exception in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. But, the protests seeking a permanent solution to the issue and a ban on the animal right’s group PETA continued on Monday .
