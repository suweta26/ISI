12-3-2017 
Chairman of the moderate Hurriyat faction Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was put under house arrest while Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik was detained on Sunday evening to foil a scheduled sit-in demonstration on Mond.

The Valleyâ€™s joint separatist leadership -- including Mirwaiz Umar, Malik and the hardliner Hurriyat faction chief Syed Ali Geelani -- had called for a day-long sit-in demonstration against the sufferings of Kashmiri prisoners languishing in various jails.

Geelani continues to be under house arrest
