Protesters in Mexico took control of vehicle lanes at one of the busiest crossings on the US border Sunday to oppose Mexican gasoline price hikes, waving through motorists after Mexican authorities abandoned their posts. Motorists zipped by about 50 demonstrators at the Otay Mesa port of entry connecting San Diego and Tijuana, many of them honking to show support.

Other protests closed southbound traffic for hours at the San Diego-Tijuana San Ysidro port of entry, the busiest crossing along the 2,000-mile border, and halted southbound traffic at one of two crossings in Nogales, Arizona. US Customs and Border Protection and California Highway Patrol officers closed southbound Interstate 5 to block access to the San Ysidro crossing, diverting traffic several miles east to the Otay Mesa port of entry.

The demonstrations, which are unrelated to the election of US President Donald Trump, have disrupted Mexican border crossings for weeks.
