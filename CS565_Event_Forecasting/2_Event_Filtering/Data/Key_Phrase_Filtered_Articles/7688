Vehicles were also set on fire, Chennai Police had to finally step in and disperse the protesters. Injured protestors have been rushed to hospital for treatment. Despite assurances from the Tamil Nadu Government to legalise Jallikattu, the crowd refused to end their protest which entered its seventh day on Monday. Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam appealed to the people to withdraw their protest, saying that amendment bill will be introduced and passed in the state assembly.

The Supreme Court had earlier on Friday agreed not to deliver its verdict next week after the Centre pointed out that a decision could create a law and order problem. Last year, the Centre allowed the sport, but that decision has been challenged in court.‚Äù
