9:00 hrs IST: Well come all to the live coverage of India vs Australia Day 2

India are once again under pressure to put their acts together. After India suffered a third batting debacle in a row on Saturday, Virat Kohli’s team are yet to look like world champions.

After off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed career-best figures of eight for 50 to help Australia bundle out India for 189, Australia openers David Warner and Matt Renshaw then piled on the misery by staying unbeaten on 23 and 15, respectively, to take their side to 40 without loss at the close.

Warner was dropped on nine by Rahane at gully off paceman Ishant Sharma to complete a wretched day for the world’s top-ranked test side. India can ill-afford a repeat today.
