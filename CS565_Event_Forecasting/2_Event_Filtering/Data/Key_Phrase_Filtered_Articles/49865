Delhi University on Tuesday is the hub of protests against the ABVP after the student group was accused of attacking students, lecturers and journalists on the campus.

Students massed outside Khalsa College shouting slogans against the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and Delhi Police over the February 21-22 disturbances on the campus. Gurmehar Kaur, the Delhi University student who alleged rape threats over her social media campaign against ABVP, withdrew from the protests. Scores of students and teachers gathered at the university for the “DU Against Goondagardi (hooliganism)” protest. Here are images from the protests.
