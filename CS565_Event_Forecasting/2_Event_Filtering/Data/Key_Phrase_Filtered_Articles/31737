Media persons came under attack from private guards at Kuvathur Golden Bay Resorts even as policemen looked on as mute spectators as the alleged attackers continued to threaten the journalists covering events relating to the AIADMK MLAs inside the resort.

On Sunday evening, the private guards who have sealed off the resort and also closed down the road leading to it, abused and manhandled the journalists. They also allegedly snatched the camera and cellphones of couple of media persons, following which the journalists sat on an impromptu dharna and shouted slogans against the AIADMK and the police.

Newsminute Editor, Dhanya Rajendran, who has visited the spot deplored the incident and said that there must be security for journalists who were doing their jobs. “How can someone have private guards in a public place?” she questioned adding that at Poes Garden too a member of the private guards, apparently hired by AIADMK, had pushed a lemale journalist.

At Kuvathur, couple of MLAs came out, apologized to the media persons, but the protests continued as the cellphones snatched by the private guards were not returned. A journalist present on the spot told a television channel that “there was not enough police protection to give any security to the journalists and get the property of the journalist back from the AIADMK men.”
