Protests against the ban on Jallikattu showed no signs of weakening on the sixth day across Tamil Nadu, despite promulgation of an ordinance which paved the way for the traditional bull-taming sport to be held in Madurai and other parts of the state on Sunday. On Saturday, Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao promulgated the ordinance but failed to resolve the standoff as protesters stuck to their demand for an amendment in the Central law.

Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said that the ordinance, which makes a Tamil Nadu-specific exception in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, a Central law, had been brought in after obtaining the President’s approval. The Chief Minister also said the government would introduce a Bill to replace the Ordinance on Monday, the first day of the Assembly session.

On Saturday, crowds of protesters in different parts of the state swelled further – Marina Beach alone held over 2.5 lakh people.
