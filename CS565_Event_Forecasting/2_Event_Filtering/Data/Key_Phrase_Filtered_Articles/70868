19-3-2017 
Jat protesters in Faridabad allegedly pelted stones on Haryana police on Sunday after they tried to stop a tractor-trolley from advancing towards Delhi for protests to be held in the national capital.

Ten people were injured in the incident on Kheri road of Faridabad, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Gudayal Singh. Those injured were rushed to Bhuna health centre for treatment.

The protesters were heading to Delhi for participating in the March 20 demonstration, organised by All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, over the community’s demand for reservation.

After the incident, the superintendent of police (SP) OP Narwal rushed to the site with a heavy force to maintain the law and order situation.

Sources said: “It was about 12.45pm when some of the Jat protesters were trying to cross a police block on Kheri road near Dhani Gopal village on their tractor-trolley. The police stopped them and some of the protesters started pelting stones on police, forcing cops to resort to lathicharge.”

Sources also said that the protesters set a police vehicle on ablaze and fled from the spot, also forcing some mediapersons from Fatehabad to sit at the dharna spot. Police have started investigation into the matter.
