A woman was assaulted by a mob after she protested against loud music in East Kolkata’s Kasba area, police said on Saturday.

Police have arrested one person in connection with the assault.

According to the victim, a group of Saraswati Puja organisers, who were celebrating by playing loud music even after 8pm on Friday, attacked her when she asked them to lower the volume.

“The puja organisers assaulted me and pushed me to the ground. The mob also abused me in a filthy language and hurled bricks at our house. One of our gates was broken,” the woman said.

“The locals were playing music well beyond the permissible limit even after two days of the puja. I only requested them to lower the volume as it was already late at night,” she said.

“We have arrested one person on the charge of assaulting the woman,” an officer from Kasba police station said.

In another incident, two people were injured in a minor clash between two groups in West Bengal’s Malda district on Saturday, police said.

“A minor clash broke out between the two groups of people hailing from the same community in Malda’s English Bazar area over playing music at a high level. The fingers of two persons were chopped during the clash and they had to be hospitalised,” said Purnendu Kundu, officer in charge of English Bazar police station.

“No one has been arrested so far,” he added.
