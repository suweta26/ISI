Hundreds of students from Lucknow University and the Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama came out in support of Fatima Nafees, mother of missing Jawaharlal Nehru University student Najeeb Ahmed, who led a protest here on Sunday.

Demanding a thorough investigation into the incident, they raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Rajnath Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh.

The students also alleged that Delhi Police did not take adequate steps to trace Ahmed, who went missing from his hostel on October 15 last year. They demanded that the authorities take action against nine members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, against whom an FIR has already been lodged.

On Saturday, Fatima had made an emotional appeal to the student fraternity to help find her son. “It has been nearly four months since my son disappeared, but the police have not been able to trace him,” she said, wondering why the safety and security of students never became a political issue.

Similar protests will be held at Jamshedpur, Jabalpur, Hyderabad and two cities in Kerala on Sunday.

Fatima had earlier led a march at Badaun, her hometown.
