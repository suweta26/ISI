Police had stepped up security arrangements to prevent any untoward incidents. Farmers said crops have started withering and they are facing loss of crop due to water scarcity.

Meanwhile, the Tungabhadra Board officials have said that the reservoir doesnâ€™t have enough water to release it for farming activities in Bellary district. Ballari Deputy Commissioner Ramprasad said criminal cases would be booked against those who indulged in violence.
