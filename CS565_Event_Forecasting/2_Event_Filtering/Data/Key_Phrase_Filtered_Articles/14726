29-1-2017 
JAIPUR: LPG distributors across the state will go on one day strike on February 15 as food and civil supplies department has refused to renew licenses of nearly 500 agencies. The distributors have also threatened to call an indefinite strike if no solution is offered by the state government.After the high court rap, food and civil supplies department asked all agencies to produce land conversion certificate to get their licenses renewed. The court in its orders had specified that commercial activities can be carried out only when the land is earmarked for that purpose.So far, the state government had provided relaxation to the agencies that have not converted their land for commercial usage. About 495 agencies in the state and 55 out of 70 operating in Jaipur are likely to be affected after the government notice. If licenses are not renewed, these agencies will not be able to supply LPG cylinders in their respective areas.The distributors, however, alleged that the state government is targeting them to cover its own failures. "We have made so many representations before the government over the years demanding guidelines or policy for LPG distributors. Just refusing to renew licenses will serve no purpose," said Deepak Singh Gehlot , president of LPG Distributors Federation of Rajasthan The federation has asked the government to classify LPG godowns and earmark places for LPG storage, the demand comes with a rider that it should not be far from the present location. The federation also claimed that the state has no jurisdiction over them as they receive clearance from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), department of the Union government.Rajasthan government, however, has asked the agencies, that are expected to be affected after its order to link their existing customers with the nearest agency that will remain operational. Officials have also refused to provide further relaxation to the distributors.
