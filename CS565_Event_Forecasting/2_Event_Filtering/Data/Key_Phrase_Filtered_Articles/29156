The five-member committee headed by Haryana chief secretary that was constituted by the state government to negotiate the demands raised by protesting Jat leaders held its first meeting on Thursday. In the meeting, additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Ram Niwas, was authorised to invite all groups for talks, on behalf of the state government.

Interacting with the media after the meeting, Niwas invited all groups for talks and submit their demands. He also asked them to inform the committee about the time, date and place when they would like to meet.

“The committee is open to dialogue with Jat leaders and discuss their demands. We will try to resolve the issues under the ambit of the constitution and in accordance with the directions issued by the high court,” he said.

The All Indian Jat Aarkshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS), the frontal organisation leading the protest, led by Yashpal Malik is holding dharnas across Haryana. Apart from this, several other Jat leaders like Hawa Singh Sangwan and Sube Singh Samain have also given the state government an ultimatum for February 26 to accept their demands.

They demand permanent government jobs to the kin of those killed during the February 2016 quota agitation and withdrawal of cases against all the accused. They have threatened to launch an “intense stir” if there demands are not met.
