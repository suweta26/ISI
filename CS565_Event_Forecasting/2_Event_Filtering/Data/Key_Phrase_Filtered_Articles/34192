Hyderabad: Taxi drivers protest against Uber after driver’s suicide 
14-2-2017 
A group of cab drivers under the aegis of Telangana Cabs Association (TCA) on Tuesday held protests at Gachibowli, demanding compensation to the kin of the cabbie, attached to taxi aggregator Uber, who allegedly committed suicide last week.

The agitators were also demanding fulfilment of other long pending demands.

TCA president, M Sunil said the future course of action will be decided on Wednesday if their demands are not met.

“We will protest tomorrow as well. If they (Government and the private taxi aggregator) don’t honour our demands will chalk out the future course of action tomorrow,” Sunil said.

The association has also been demanding hike in their earning and incentives. A cab driver who was under a partnership with the aggregator allegedly committed suicide last week, after he “defaulted” monthly instalment of his cab, said the TCA president.

Meanwhile, a statement issued by Uber said “Our heart goes out to M Kondaiah and his family, who has been driving part-time since March last year. As always, we stand ready to extend our complete support to the authorities.”
