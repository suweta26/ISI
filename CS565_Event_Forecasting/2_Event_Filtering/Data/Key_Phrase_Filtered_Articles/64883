The Mexican football federation has toughened a disciplinary ruling against two players after angry referees staged a protest strike over the weekend.

Referees refused to officiate matches after the league didn’t harshly punish two players who shoved officials last week. One player for Club Toluca shoved a referee after an expulsion and a player for the America squad appeared to head-butt another referee after a call.

The referees involved reported both players for “aggression,” which is punished by banning players for up to one year. But the league’s disciplinary committee instead gave the players eight- and 10-match suspensions for the lesser offense of “attempted aggression.”

After the strike, the federation reversed itself and imposed a one-year ban and fines for both players.

Referees announced they were ending the strike.
