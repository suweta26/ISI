‘Boys will be boys’: Modi digs up Mulayam’s 2014 comment at Budaun rally 
11-2-2017 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a scathing attack at Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on his ‘boys make mistakes’ comment.

“A Samajwadi Party MLA from Budaun levelled serious allegations against a Samajwadi Party MP and if a reporter approaches Mulayam ji for comment, he would have said that boys make mistakes,” PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Budaun.

Tearing into the Akhilesh Yadav government, Modi alleged it of playing with aspirations of youth of the state for political gains.

“Akhilesh Yadav government is playing with the aspirations of youth for its political gains. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has been sheltering the criminals and goons in the state,” he added.

Questioning the development in Budaun, a SP stronghold, PM Modi said, “Budaun is among 100 backward districts. I had heard about Budaun when I was in Gujarat (as the state’s CM). Why has development not reached this land under the regimes of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party.”

During an event in 2014, then Samajwadi Party national president Mulayam Singh Yadav had protested against the proposal of an anti-rape law, saying “Boys will be boys. They make mistakes”. The remark had drawn flak from all fronts.

On Friday, PM Modi had said that the truth of Uttar Pradesh CM will be exposed on March 11 when results of the elections will be declared.

Modi also criticised the Samajwadi Party for misusing law for its own benefit by imprisoning some BJP workers.

“Is the law used like this? The BJP workers were forcibly imprisoned. Who misuses law for its personal motive?” he added.
