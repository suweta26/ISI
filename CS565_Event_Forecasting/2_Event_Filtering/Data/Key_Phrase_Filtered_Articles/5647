On Friday, the DMK held ‘Rail Roko Agitation’, under which the protesters also halted a train at Chennai’s Mambalam Railway Station. Stalin was taken into preventive custody for halting a train, but was later released.

Meanwhile, the Centre, in a major relief to the people of Tamil Nadu, gave its nod to the ordinance on the sport. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, urging him to pass ordinance on the support. In response, PM Modi ensured full support from the Centre.

The ordinance, proposed by the Tamil Nadu Government, was placed before the Law, Environment and Culture Ministries. In consultation with Attorney General of India Mukul Rohatgi, the Ministries forwarded the ordinance to President Pranab Mukherjee for his assent.
