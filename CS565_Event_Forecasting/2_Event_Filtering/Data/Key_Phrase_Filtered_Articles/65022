Reservation row in Haryana: Jat protesters observe ‘Black Holi’; burn effigies of PM Modi 
14-3-2017 
Jat protesters in Rohtak and adjoining districts on Sunday burnt effigies of BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, and observed ‘Black Holi’ at the ongoing dharnas to press for their demands, including reservation and withdrawal of cases against the community youths in connection with last year’s stir.

Visibly upset with the BJP’s spectacular victory in Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly elections, All India Jat Aarakshan Samiti (AIJASS) president Yashpal Malik, who hails from UP and had been maintaining that BJP will not get Jats’ support in the state, said the saffron polarised the electorate on communal lines and secured the Jat votes as well.

“However, we will not be disappointed. It’s because of our movement that BJP president Amit Shah had to repeatedly say in his election rallies in UP that they are with the Jat community. Our protest made them nervous and they had to hold meetings with local Jat leaders to win their confidence,” he said while addressing protesters at Jassia village in Rohtak.

“PM Modi also had to invoke former Prime Minister and Jat leader Charan Singh’s name in his speech during an election rally to woo farmers and the Jat community,” he said.

Malik said that it was now the BJP’s turn to support the Jat community and accept its demands after the party’s landslide victory in UP.

Hitting back at finance minister Captain Abhimanyu for criticising him, Malik said, “The BJP has won in UP and the Captain is being arrogant in Haryana. He should resign and contest the elections again to see where he stands.”

He said Jat protesters would go ahead with their proposed ‘Delhi March’ on March 20 and their plan to gherao Parliament. “The government has a few days to agree to our demands if it wants us to end our agitation.”
