Nigeria: 11 killed at pro-Trump rally; police deny it 
20-1-2017 
A member of a separatist group in southern Nigeria says 11 people were killed when security forces cracked down on a demonstration in support of US President-elect Donald Trump, though police deny there were any deaths. Ugochukwu Chinweuba of the Indigenous People of Biafra says police and soldiers used live rounds to break up today’s demonstration in Rivers state.

Nnamdi Omoni, a spokesman for Rivers state police, says the claim is false and that police only used tear gas. Neither of the competing accounts could be independently verified. The demonstrators urged Trump to support their demands for an independent Biafran state for Nigeria’s Igbo people.

In November, Amnesty International accused Nigeria’s military of killing 150 pro-Biafra protesters. The army denied the allegations, saying soldiers used “maximum restraint.”
