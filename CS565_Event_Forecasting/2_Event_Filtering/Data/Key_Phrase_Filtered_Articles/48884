A senior Taliban commander was killed on Sunday in Afghanistan’s Kunduz province, according to the Afghan President and the militant group.

During a ceremony on Monday honouring the country’s security and defence forces, said that Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban’s shadow governor for Kunduz province, had been killed.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid also confirmed Salam’s death, saying it was from an American airstrike in the Dashti Archi district of Kunduz province.

Ghani, in his comments, did not elaborate on how Salam died. Speaking to thousands of security forces members in a ceremony at the Kabul military airport, Ghani said that Salam and his fighters “were eliminated in Kunduz, because of you”.

At the ceremony Ghani emphasised Afghanistan independence and said that the Taliban and other militant groups are no match for the Afghan security forces.
