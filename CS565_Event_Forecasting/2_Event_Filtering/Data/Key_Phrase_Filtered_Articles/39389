19-2-2017 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is addressing a Bhartiya Janata Party rally in Fatehpur’s Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.

His rally comes two days after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra shared the stage in Rae Bareli, attacking Modi’s “suit boot ki sarkar”.

403 constituencies of Uttar Pradesh vote in seven phases, starting February 11. The election results will be counted on March 11.

Here are the live updates:

• Modi ends the address by appealing to crowd to opt for BJP in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections 2017.

• On November 8, I jolted the nation. Those people who had black money will speak against me, conspire against me, but I did this for the common man: Modi on the Centre’s decision to demonetise currency.

“My fight is with the big fishes, not the ones who dedicatedly work... I’m sure I have the blessings of the common man.”

• On employment, Modi asks if anyone can get a job in today’s time without connections or references. “Should such a practice be allowed. Development for has to be for everyone... We (BJP) didn’t say we will provide amenities according to caste or religion. We’ll provide services to all who are in the line.”

“UP’s biggest issue is discrimination.”
