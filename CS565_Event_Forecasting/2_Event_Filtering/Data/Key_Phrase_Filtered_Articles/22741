AIIMS health services hit as nurses protest over colleague’s death 
5-2-2017 
More than 500 nurses of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) went on a strike on Sunday to protest against the death of colleague due to alleged negligence of the doctors.

The strike has affected services in wards, including at ICU and critical care units. The nurses’ union has threatened to stop work even in the emergency department if the erring junior doctors are not suspended.

According to Sukhlal Jat, a member of the nursing union, one of their colleagues, Rajbir Kaur, who was pregnant, was admitted to the hospital for a normal delivery on January 16.

During treatment, she lost her baby and was put on life support and died last night.

“Following her pre-natal checkups, Kaur was admitted to AIIMS for a normal delivery, but the doctors did not monitor her properly. The fetal heartbeat dropped and she was taken to the operation theatre,” said Harish kr Kajla, the president of AIIMS nursing union.

“It was a still born and even the mother had a cardiac arrest on the table. She was taken to the ICU and was declared dead last night after midnight,” he said.

“We lost one of our colleagues due to the negligence of the doctors. We want the doctors who were involved in the negligence towards her to be terminated. We can discuss about our other demands with the AIIMS administration but we want the termination of doctors,” said Jat.

He said that they haven’t yet received a response from the AIIMS administration.

“We cannot suspend the doctors without ascertaining whether they were at fault. We have constituted an eight-member committee, including doctors from Safdarjung and representatives from Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA),” said Dr Balram Airan, acting director, AIIMS. The committee has to submit a report in seven days.

Police said that the post-mortem of the deceased will be conducted.
