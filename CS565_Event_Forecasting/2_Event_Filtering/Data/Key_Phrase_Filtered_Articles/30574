11-2-2017 
Commuting within Delhi-NCR was hit for the second day as drivers of mobile-based cab aggregators continued their strike against Ola and Uber.

On Saturday, reports of cab drivers being stopped by protesting drivers came in from across NCR, affecting the few passengers who could avail the service. Sumana Vasistha, an investment banker narrated her experience and said, “After trying continuously for 20 minutes in Ola and Uber, I finally got an Ola cab. But I had a harrowing time as we were stopped by protesting drivers near Dwarka Sector 21 Metro station. He had to hide his mobile and then pose as if it was an office cab. They let us go after 10 minutes of interrogation.”

The drivers are demanding that fares for the rides should be increased from ₹6 per kilometer, which is far lower than ₹16 per km (for air-conditioned cabs) — the minimum fare prescribed by the Delhi government for radio taxis. Besides, a reduction in incentives for drivers has further irked them.

The protest has led to a massive shortage of cabs in the city due to which cab aggregators are enforcing surge pricing for every ride. Ola has even sent a notification to all its users that reads, “Please be advised that, due to the local strike, cabs will be subject to availability.” The cab aggregator has also temporarily removed the share option from the mobile app and is instead requesting its users to consider using its Ola Auto service.

However, there are some drivers who want to report for work but are being hauled up by the protesters. A driver told HT that a group of drivers stopped his car in Ballabhgarh area and took away his phone. “After pleading and promising that I will head home, they returned my phone,” he said.
