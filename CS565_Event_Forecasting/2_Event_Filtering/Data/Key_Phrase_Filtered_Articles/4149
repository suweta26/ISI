More than 80 Islamic State jihadists were killed in US strikes on training camps in Libya, including several who were involved in plotting attacks in Europe, Pentagon chief Ashton Carter said on Thursday.

“They certainly are people who were actively plotting operations in Europe and may also have been connected to some attacks that have already occurred in Europe,” Carter said on his last day in office.
