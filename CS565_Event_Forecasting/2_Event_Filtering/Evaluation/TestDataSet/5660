Jallikattu protests LIVE: After rail roko, DMK begins hunger protest 
21-1-2017 
Jallikattu appears set to become legal again, with the Centre and Tamil Nadu government working in tandem to bring a state ordinance to circumvent a Supreme Court ban on the traditional and popular bull-taming sport.

A draft ordinance that the state government sent to the Union home ministry on Friday was cleared by the law and environment ministries.

Protesters at Marina beach in Chennai greeted the announcement on the ordinance with loud cheers and claps. But declared that they won’t budge until a formal order is out and court lifted the ban.
