India is poised to be the second largest driver of global growth in 2020

Between 2014 and 2015, global GDP growth was 3.1%, nearly half of this attributable to strong economic activity in China, India and Indonesia. In PPP dollars, Indiaâ€™s contribution to global growth was equal to that of the US and lower than China. By 2020, India will become the second most important economy and, with China, will contribute more than 40% of global growth.
