Telecom major Vodafone today announced the launch of its Vodafone SuperNet 4G service here. The service was launched by sporting legend Milkha Singh here.

Starting with Chandigarh today, the Punjab capital, the SuperNet 4G will shortly be rolled out across major towns and cities of the state by March 2017, Vodafone India Operations Director Arvind Vohra said on the occasion.

He said the SuperNet 4G will enable customers to access internet via mobile with speeds across a range of smart devices including Wi-Fi and dongles.

Vodafone 4G services can be readily accessed from 4G enabled handsets offered by leading smartphone manufacturers and available across the country, he said.

The Vodafone’s SuperNet 4G launch in Punjab follows the successful rollout of services in Kerala, Karnataka, Kolkata, Delhi and NCR, Mumbai, Haryana, UP (east), Gujarat, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Assam and North East, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and UP (west) circles, he said.

With launches planned in several other prominent locations across the country, Vodafone SuperNet 4G coverage will be available in 2,400 towns by March 2017. The 17 Circles where Vodafone is offering 4G service, contribute over 90 per cent of Vodafone India’s data revenues, it was informed on the occasion. Vohra said out of a network of 10,000 plus Vodafone exclusive stores in the country, more than 220 are in Punjab.

Long term differentiator will be really superior customer experience, consitently superior customer relevant propositions, which is where Vodafone SuperNet 4G comes. Having said that, we have also come out with lot of exciting offers on the 4G launch”.
