The Madras High Court has said it will not "interfere" on the issue of protests in the city against the ban on Jallikattu, holding that the Supreme Court was seized of the matter.

The court made this observation when a mention was made by an advocate K Balu in the open court about the protests at the Marina on the Jallikattu issue.
