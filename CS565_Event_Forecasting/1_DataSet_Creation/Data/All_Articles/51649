Sedition case: Arrest warrant sought against Hardik Patel for not appearing in court 
1-3-2017 
An arrest warrant was sought on Wednesday against Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel for not appearing in a court in Surat.

Hardik has a sedition case registered against him in the city. As per the bail condition, he has to appear before a court here every week.

His lawyer Yashwant Vala on Wednesday requested for an exemption for his client from appearance before district judge Geeta Gopi.

Hardik could not come because he had to attend some social functions, the lawyer said.

The judge then allowed Hardik to appear on March 15.

However, prosecutor Nayan Sukhadwala opposed this concession and demanded an arrest warrant against Hardik.

By remaining absent Hardik violated the condition imposed by the high court while granting him bail, he said.

The judge said she would hear the application for warrant on Friday.
