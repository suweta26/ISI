BJP used money for forming govt. in Goa, Manipur: Rahul Gandhi 
16-3-2017 
Lashing out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for government formation in Manipur and Goa despite finishing second in a split mandate, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that the saffron party used money to win power.

“We won the assembly polls in Manipur, Goa and Punjab. BJP used money for forming government in Goa and Manipur. They have stolen the government,” Gandhi said after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Captain Amrinder Singh here.

Gandhi also thanked the people of Punjab for showing faith in the Congress and assured to work for the state tirelessly.

He also expressed gratitude to the people of Goa and Manipur for their love and support to the Congress and congratulated the party workers and leaders in both states.

Meanwhile, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who faced the crucial floor test today in the Goa Assembly, established victory as 22 MLAs stood in his support.

16 MLAs opposed Parrikar’s candidature as the Chief Minister, while one MLA was absent.

Parrikar, who stepped down as Defence Minister, was sworn-in as the chief minister of the coastal state for the fourth time on Tuesday evening, along with nine ministers.

But with the Congress challenging his appointment, citing Goa Governor Mridula Sinha did not follow the procedure as dictated by the Constitution, the Supreme Court earlier this week asked the test to be conducted today.

A special Assembly session was convened for the purpose.

Parrikar had claimed the support of 22 legislators, two more than the halfway mark in the 40-member Assembly.

The BJP bagged 13 seats in the polls, while it claimed the support of three MLAs each of the Goa Forward Party and Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party, besides three independents. The Congress won 17 seats.
