India Inc can now register trademark as ‘well-known’ by paying more

Companies can now apply for their trademark to be recognised as a ‘well-known’. This new notification will not only prevent infringement that could result in misleading the public, it will also help companies save on litigation costs. This is a significant development and the change was notified in Trade Mark Rules 2017 on March 6. Prior to this notification, only courts had a say in any dispute regarding the use of a well-known trademark.
