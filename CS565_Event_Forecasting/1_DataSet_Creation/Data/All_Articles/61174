9-3-2017 
India petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and US energy secretary Rick Perry discussed growing cooperation between the two countries in the energy sector in the first minister-level interaction with the Trump administration on Wednesday.

In view of India’s growing demand for energy — estimated to escalate to 30% of the total incremental demand over the next 25 years — the minister told reporters that India’s engagement with the US acquires a completely different dimension. “I had an open and free discussion with secretary Perry about it,” he added.

The two officials also discussed the export of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to India from early 2018. Indian investments in LNG and Shale sector in the US —by both the government and the private sector — were also discussed.

Pradhan is on a three-day visit to the US, during which he also travelled to Boston and Houston. He attended the CERAWeek in Houston where he announced the new bidding round for exploration of oil and gas in India that will start from July 2017.

In Houston, Pradhan met his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Sri Lanka, Canada and CEO of ADNOC (State company of UAE).

Saudi minister Khalid Al-Falih told him about the new business environment in India, Pradhan said, adding, specially the speed with which things get done now. And he also recalled feeling all charged up after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the minister added.

He also met several industry leaders and experts such as BP CEO Bob Dudley and IEA executive director Fatih Birol. He also met Governor of Texas Mr Greg Abbott. In Boston, the minister addressed students and faculty at MIT, Harvard Kennedy School and Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University. At MIT, he met Ernest Muniz, the former US energy secretary.
