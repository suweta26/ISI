Chinese man suffers racial attack in US 
16-3-2017 
BEIJING: A woman hit a Chinese man on a bus in New York saying she hates Chinese. She used the same kind of invective that accomplished the violence and killing of a few Indians since Donald Trump took charge as the president of the United States.The Chinese man, 68-year-old Wang Zenxin , was whacked over the head with a umbrella by a woman on a bus in New York on March 7, according to a delayed report.When Wang asked why she was behaving in a violent manner, the middle aged Hispanic woman said, "Because I hate Chinese people."She asked Wang to go back to his country saying the US is no place for the Chinese. The woman also shoved and pushed Wang until he cut short his journey getting off at the next stop, according to eyewitnesses, one of whom made a video of the scene.The video has been widely circulated over the internet. But the state media, which is usually alert to cases of injustice against Chinese living abroad, has soft-pedalled this issue. They are apparently taking a cue from top Chinese officials who have been taking a conciliatory approach to China-US relations ahead of the expected meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and Trump next month."I feel sad and I feel very uncomfortable," New York Daily News quoted Wang as saying. "I think New York is a nice city, many kinds of races of people, all of them together, very nice, very peacefully. Now I know that some people hate Chinese and I have to be careful."Wang has been living in New York since 1986 when he first came from China.
