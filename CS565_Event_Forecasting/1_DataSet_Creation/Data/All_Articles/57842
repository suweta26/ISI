Briefing mediapersons after finance minister Capt Abhimanyu presented the 2017-18 budget in the Vidhan Sabha, leader of Opposition in Haryana assembly Abhay Chautala and INLD state president Ashok Arora said the budget failed to give any relief to any section of the society.

Abhay termed the budget as an attempt of the Khattar government to mislead the people with figures whereas it had done nothing to fulfil the promises it made in its election manifesto.

The INLD leaders said the budget had no provisions to give unemployment allowance to the educated youth, Rs 2,000 old age pension, regularise guest teachers, Punjab pay-scale to state employees or implementation of the Swaminathan commission recommendations for the farmers.
