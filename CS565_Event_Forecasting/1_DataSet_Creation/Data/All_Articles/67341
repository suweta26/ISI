Sensex, Nifty may open up as Fed signals “gradual” rate hikes 
16-3-2017 
Indian markets may open higher on Thursday tracking firm Asian and US bourses after the dollar weakened on US Federal Reserve’s comment that further interest rate hikes will be “gradual”.

On Wednesday, Fed hiked key policy rates by 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage point to a range of 0.75-1.00%, as it was expected, but global investors took comfort from the stance of a slower pace of tightening going forward. Earlier, market experts were expecting rapid rate hikes that could have led to capital outflow from riskier assets and emerging markets.

Ahead of the Fed, India’s 30-share benchmark Sensex closed down 44.5 points or 0.15% at 29,398.11. The broader Nifty ended at 9,084.80, tad below the historic high touched on Tuesday.

Asian markets were up tracking solid gains at the Wall Street. The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to its highest since mid-2015.

Nikkei was down in early trade as yen strengthened against the dollar and cut export competitiveness of Japanese firms, while Hang Seng was up 1.1%, Kospi 0.6%, Strait Times 0.8% and Shanghai 0.6%.

In the US, Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 0.7%.

The dollar plunged against major currencies after the Fed signaled a more gradual pace of monetary tightening this year, contrary to what the market was expecting.

The dollar index fell to two-week lows and touched 100.78, down 0.9%. The euro rose to five-week highs against the dollar and hovered around $1.0696, up 0.9%. The greenback was down to a two-week low against the yen and UK sterling.

Fed said in its policy statement it was sticking to the outlook for two more rate hikes this year and three more in 2018 as the job market was buoyant and inflation was closer to its medium term target of 2%. The Fed last hiked rates once in December 2016.
