– It also introduced the “Exam Centre Locator” mobile app to help parents and student on the exam day. It functions as it is named— a GPS which will identify the exam centre based on the students’ roll numbers and provide pictures and routes to get there easily.

– It dispatched all required materials to the exam centres and made sure that all schools have downloaded the admit cards.

– It will appoint full time observers at “sensitive” exam centres and has already arranged with local authorities to ensure trouble free examination everywhere.

– Scanned photographs have been included in admit cards and question papers have been sealed to prevent any unfair means.

– It has kept a three-tier arrangement for surprise checking. These include the flying squads and special observers.

– Supervisors and district committees have been informed and will be assisting in conducting proper examinations.
