8-3-2017 
A bus plunged into a ravine outside Ecuador’s capital on Tuesday, killing 11 people and injuring at least 25 others, authorities said.

“There are 11 dead at this time,” in the crash in Guayllabamba, the Emergency Office said in a post on Twitter. “Twenty-five are being tended to medically.”

Traffic accidents are one of mountainous Ecuador’s leading causes of death.

In January, at least 20 people died and 17 were injured when a school vehicle collided with a long-distance bus in southwestern Ecuador.
