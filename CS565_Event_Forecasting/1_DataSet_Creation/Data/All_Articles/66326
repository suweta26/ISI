Arvind Kejriwal rakes up ‘EVM tampering’ again, seeks poll panel intervention 
15-3-2017 
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal alleged on Wednesday that large-scale irregularities in electronic voting machines had transferred a fourth of the Aam Aadmi Party’s votes to opponents in Punjab, demanding that the election commission rethink using paper ballots in future elections.

Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Kejriwal read out a list of constituencies where the AAP apparently got an unusually low number of votes, and argued that EVMs should be withdrawn as they are prone to tampering.

“Developed countries have given up EVMs. Even the Supreme Court has said EVMs are prone to tampering. Should we not rethink?” ANI quoted Kejriwal as saying.

His comments came a day after the AAP chief demanded paper ballots in the upcoming Delhi municipal polls. The EC has rejected the demand and dismissed any speculation around EVM tampering.

“Election Commission’s responsibility to keep people’s faith in EVM. They cannot shirk responsibility.”

Despite hype surrounding its high-profile assembly poll debut in Punjab, the AAP finished a poor second in Punjab, far behind the Congress that cruised to power with a near two-thirds majority.

Kejriwal is the second leader after Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati to raise questions about EVMs. The Dalit leader had demanded the cancellation of the Uttar Pradesh poll results and blamed EVMs for the BJP’s unexpected bumper victory in India’s largest state.
