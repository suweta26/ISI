6-3-2017 
State-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) is likely to commence commercial operations at the second unit of the 1,000 MW Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in Tamil Nadu from April this year.

The second unit with the Russian-designed VVER-1000 reactor was synchronised with the southern grid on August 29 last year and has already reached 100% operating capacity.

“We have already commissioned power generation from the second unit and it is running efficiently. We are waiting for last few clearances from the authorities concerned, which we expect to receive by next month. We are hopeful of starting commercial operations at this unit by April,” a NPCIL official told PTI in Mumbai.

The first unit of 1,000 MW achieved first criticality in mid-2013. It was connected to the grid in October 2013 and began commercial operation in December 2014.

KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 reactors built in collaboration with Atomstroyexport, the Russian state company and NPCIL, with an installed capacity of 6,000 MW.

The official further said the work on the third unit is underway and will take another five years for commissioning.
