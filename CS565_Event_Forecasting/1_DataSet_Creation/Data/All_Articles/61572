pathankot uri: No proper action taken after Pathankot, Uri attacks: Parliament Panel 
10-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: The defence ministry has displayed a “lack of sincerity” to improve security measures at military installations and bases despite repeated attacks, a high-powered parliamentary panel led by senior BJP leader Maj Gen BC Khanduri (retd) has alleged.In stinging remarks directed at the ministry for an apparent lack of action after the Pathankot attack that led to the death of seven combatants, the standing committee on defence has said that despite a report on improving security by former Army Vice Chief Philip Campose that was submitted in May 2016, no action seems to have been taken.“The security scenario is vulnerable as has been exposed during Pathankot Uri attacks. Yet, no concrete measures appear to have been taken even after a lapse of 6-7 months of the submission of the report,” the report, which was submitted to parliament on Thursday reads.The committee, which consists of senior leaders that represent all political parties in the two houses of parliaments, also pulled up the ministry for a lack of sincerity. “The Committee are distressed to note the apparent lack of sincerity on the part of the Ministry of Defence in this regard and desire that situation should improve,” the report says.As reported by ET on 2 December 2016, a detailed plan to set up perimeter defence systems and intrusion alert devices at forward locations and Army garrisons in J&K has been pending government clearance.The plan to strengthen defences at armed forces installations in the sensitive state was drawn up after an attack at Pathankot airbase in January 2016 in which militants managed to breach a military airfield and involved an initial outlay of Rs 400 cr.While the plan was never implemented, a strike was carried out by Pakistan-based militants against an Indian Army camp in Uri in October that left 19 soldiers dead.
