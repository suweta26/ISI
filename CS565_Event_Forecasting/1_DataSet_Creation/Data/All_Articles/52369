India opener KL Rahul explained how the Indian team goes through a net session. On Thursday, he was explain the process in a BCCI video and also talked out various aspects in the nets.

“We have three nets. One for spinners, one for pacers and the last one is where our coaches Sanjay Bangar and Raghu help us with the stick (throw-downs). That is where we practice a particular skill. It is upto the individual whether you want to practice short-ball, reverse-swinging ball, if you want to play sweeps shots, anything. It is up to you. The coaches will help you,” KL Rahul said.

Rahul then explained the three nets with detail one-by-one. First he went to the spinners’ net and explained what the batsmen try to do in the nets.

Then he explained the pacers net where Ishant Sharma and net bowlers bowling at Karun Nair. Rahul said this is where most of the battle is won.

“If you practice with intent and you practice with lot of focus, that is 50 percent of the battle won for the batsman,” he said.

Rahul also talked about the time spent in each nets and how net sessions are divided when there are three days left for a match and when there is only a day left for a match.

“The final net is where where need to focus and be top of your game,” he said.
