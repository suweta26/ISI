Panneerselvam faction of AIADMK constitutes parliamentary board 
12-3-2017 
Rebel AIADMK faction led by O Panneerselvam on Sunday constituted its Parliamentary Board and announced 13 members for the top body.

Days after the AIADMK Parliamentary Board was reconstituted, with party general secretary VK Sasikala replacing her predecessor late J Jayalalithaa as its head, the rebel faction disputed the setting up of the new board.

Presidium chairman of the dissident group, E Madusudanan, said “as per party rules only party general secretary had the authority to name members for the top party body,” indicating that the announcement of a board led by Sasikala was not valid.

“Since the post of party general secretary is now vacant, I appoint new members to the Parliamentary Board,” he said in a party release adding he had been named party presidium chairman already by the party’s General Council.

While Madusudanan will be the chief of the Board, former chief minister O Panneereselvam, former ministers C Ponnaiyan, K Pandiarajan, Rajya Sabha member V Maithreyan are among the newly named 13 members.

The Panneerselvam camp has already challenged before the Election Commission the appointment of Sasikala as General Secretary following which the commission has sought her response.
