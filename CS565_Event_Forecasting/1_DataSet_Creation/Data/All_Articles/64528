The Union Minister of State for Home said police are investigating the case and his office is also pursuing it for action against those guilty in the incident. Higio Guntey, who hails from Arunachal Pradesh and is a fourth-semester student of Christ University, was allegedly beaten and forced to lick his house owner’s shoes for using excessive water in Bengaluru on March 6.

The house owner was identified as Hemanth Kumar and a case was registered against him on March 9 following Guntey’s complaint. Rijiju also hails from Arunachal Pradesh.
