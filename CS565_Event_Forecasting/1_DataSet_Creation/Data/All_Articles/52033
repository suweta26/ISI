It was located by a cargo ship taking part in a search and rescue operation launched after a telephone call to Greek police late Wednesday reported a ship in trouble with dozens of people on board. The coast guard says the migrants were being transferred early Thursday to one of four cargo ships in the area, which would then take them to Kalamata.

There was no immediate information about the health of the passengers, their nationality or destination.
