Haryana BJP divided? Legislator claims some MLAs think they are ‘avatars’ of Vishnu 
8-3-2017 
A Bhartiya Janata Party MLA from Haryana has accused other party legislators of assuming they are “avatars” of Hindu god Vishnu.

Santosh Sarwan, part of a a BJP faction in Haryana along with 15 others, lashed out at alleged step-motherly treatment meted out to them by the Khattar government over the rival group.

“Every MLA wants that he/she be heard. But there is one set of MLAs who are trying to run the show and throw their weight around. They are not avatars of Lord Vishnu. We only want we too should be heard,” said Santosh, the BJP MLA from Mullana.

Another dissatisfied MLA Umesh Aggarwal went to the extent of pointing fingers at the BJP government in connection with the alleged irregularities in Gurugram affordable housing scheme, launched in 2013. He even raised the matter in the assembly on Tuesday.

Chief minister ML Khattar, however, denied any rivalry among the party MLAs and said: “None of our party MLAs are dissatisfied or unhappy. All of them stand united.”

Asked if some of his MLAs are lobbying against him, Khattar told reporters, “No lobbying of any kind occurs in the party. We take all decisions by consensus. I will stay as CM only on consensual decision, so will the any one else replacing me.”

Speaking to reporters outside the House, Aggarwal, alluding to MLAs alleging step-motherly treatment, said, “We don’t want to change the government, we don’t want to change the chief minister or leadership. We only want systemic changes.”
