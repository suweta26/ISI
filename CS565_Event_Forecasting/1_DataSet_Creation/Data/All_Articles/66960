Sukhoi, Chetak crashes bring to forefront serviceability, upgradation issues 
15-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: With a frontline Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet and a Chetak helicopter crashing in different parts of the country on Wednesday, the IAF continues to record an alarmingly high crash rate. Fortunately, the pilots in both the crashes managed to escape safely.The armed forces have lost over 60 aircraft and helicopters in crashes, which have killed over 80 people, just since 2011. With the two primary reasons being technical defects and human error, the combination of ageing machines, inadequate training to rookie pilots, shoddy maintenance and poor quality of spares continues to be a deadly mix and exact a heavy toll.Though military aviation is inherently dangerous in nature, with pilots practising bombing and low-level flying missions or helping in risky rescue operations, the crash rate seems unacceptably high. There have been well over 1,300 crashes of fighters, aircraft and helicopters recorded in the armed forces since 1970.On Wednesday, the Chetak helicopter developed engine failure on a routine sortie from the Bamrauli airfield near Allahabad at around 7 am. "The two pilots tried to land on an uneven field nearby but the helicopter toppled over," said an officer.Seven hours later, the Sukhoi-30MKI took off on a training sortie from the forward Utarlai airbase, in Barmer area of Rajasthan, but it also developed a technical snag soon after. The two pilots then went in for "a planned ejection" to parachute down safely at about 2.15 pm, but three villagers were left injured on the ground.While the armed forces are still forced to fly the ageing single-engine Cheetah/Chetak helicopters due to failure of successive governments to take timely decisions, the crash of the twin-seat Sukhoi "air dominance" fighter is more worrisome.IAF has now lost at least seven of the 240 Sukhoi-30MKI jets it has inducted till now. In all, India has contracted 272 Sukhois from Russia for over $12 billion, with the bulk of them being "produced under licence" by Hindustan Aeronautics.The Sukhoi fleet is now likely to be grounded for systematic precautionary checks before they can take to the skies again, like it happened after crashes in April 2009 and December 2011. Last year, then defence minister Manohar Parrikar had admitted to problems with the Sukhois, citing 69 incidents of technical glitches mainly revolving around the engines in the previous three years, as was reported by TOI.There are still persisting doubts over serviceability of the Sukhoi fleet due to engine problems, shoddy maintenance, poor availability and management of spares, though the government now says it has improved to over 60% now from the earlier 52%.The technical problems dogging the Sukhoi fleet need to be urgently resolved because the fighters are critical for maintaining effective deterrence against both China and Pakistan, especially since IAF is down to just 33 fighter squadrons when 44 are required.
