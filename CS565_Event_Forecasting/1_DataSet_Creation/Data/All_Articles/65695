A polytechnic student was on Tuesday arrested for allegedly damaging glass doors of two ATMs run by private firms after the machine failed to dispense cash, police said.

The frustrated student identified as Amir Khan kicked and broke the glass doors of two ATMs, Sultan Bazar Police Station Inspector P Shiva Shankar Rao told PTI.

Amir also injured his right leg in the process, he said.

“Amir is saying that he visited several ATMs for the past two days but was unable to withdraw cash. Today, traffic police personnel caught him while he was driving his bike and asked him to pay the outstanding amount of Rs 1,800 towards pending challans,” the inspector said.

According to Amir, he visited around five ATMs but was unable to withdraw cash which angered him, the officer said.

He was arrested after a case was registered against him under relevant sections of IPC and provisions of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, the inspector added.I
