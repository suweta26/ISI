A day after reports claimed that TV star Kapil Sharma had an ugly fight with his co-actor Sunil Grover, the comedian-actor has brushed the controversy aside, claiming that they fight for “good work”.

The cast of the popular comedy show was returning from Australia after a performance tour, when an altercation between Sharma (who is said to have been drunk) and his crew broke out, an Indian Express report said. Grover tried to intervene in the scuffle, but Sharma got physical with him, while others looked on. Grover, who stood by Sharma after he cut ties with Colors channel and moved to Sony with his new show, later apologised to the other passengers on his friend’s behalf, it added.

Reacting to the reports, Kapil told Bollywoodlife, ““Mujhe yaad nahi (I don’t remember). Actually hamari har flight main ladai hoti hai (We fight on every flight)…har jagah ladai hoti hai (We fight everywhere)…It is a healthy fight…We fight for work…We fight for good work.”

Meanwhile, a DNA report claimed that Grover has decided to quit the show, after he had the recent fight with Kapil.

“Sunil is not coming back on The Kapil Sharma Show. He had already recorded the episodes for this weekend (March 18-19) . But he is not returning to the show. Abb bahot ho gaya. Agar Kapil ka yehi rawaiya raha toh aur log bhi nikal jayenge (enough is enough,if Kapil continues in this manner others will also quit),” DNA quoted a source as saying.

Hindustan Times could not independently verify the reports.
