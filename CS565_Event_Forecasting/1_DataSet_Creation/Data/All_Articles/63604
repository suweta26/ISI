Meanwhile, in the ongoing four test match series between India and Australia, Virat Kohli has not been in great form with the bat and he will look to change that. Along with Kohli the entire Indian batting unit looks out of form as they have been bowled out for under 200 in three out of the four innings.

Before the start of the four-match series, India had posted 600-plus totals in their previous three innings, against England and Bangladesh. Their first three innings against Australia were all below 200. However, the only bright spots in the batting department are Cheteshwar Puajra and Ajinkya Rahane who battled it out in the middle and played crucial knocks, which helped India bag a victory in Bangalore.
