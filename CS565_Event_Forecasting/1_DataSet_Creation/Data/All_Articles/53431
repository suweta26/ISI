Indian share markets opened lower on Friday tracking global cues and firm dollar as investors are nervous over a possible interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve in March policy review.

The 30-share benchmark Sensex opened lower and fell 88 points or 0.3% to 28,751.74 but recovered. The Nifty was down 0.2% at 8,881 as investors booked profits and as global uncertainties over Fed rate hike and Brexit.

Asian markets traded lower with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.4%.

Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.6%, Kospi was down 1.3% and Strait Times 1% and Shanghai 0.4%.

On Friday, the dollar gained on expectation of Fed rate hike, which halted the winning streak at the Wall Street.

On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to trigger Article 50 on March 15 for exiting European Union despite an overwhelming defeat at the House of Lords.

Hawkish comments from Fed officials boosted the probability of rate hike this month to 74% from just 30% at the start of the week. Investors are waiting to hear Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer later on Friday to get fresh cues.
