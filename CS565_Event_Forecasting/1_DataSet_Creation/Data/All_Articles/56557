6-3-2017 
TV comedy star Kapil Sharma graced the couch on Bollywood’s newest father, Karan Johar’s talk show, Koffee with Karan ,with this Sunday and brought the house down with a laugh riot. The comedian was unapologetically frank about his English, middle-class upbringing and much more.

From his well-known crush on Deepika Padukone to his little-known gate-crashing a Shah Rukh Khan party, Kapil talked about everything. Here are some of the best moments from the episode:

When Karan asked where Kapil got his sense of humour from, the comedian said, “Mere mummy-papa se. Meri mummy actually bahut funny hain. Unko nahi pata par wo bahut funny hain.”

During his conversation, Kapil revealed that he once accidentally gatecrashed Shah Rukh Khan’s party. “It was Dilwale’s celebration and we were not even dressed for the occasion,” Kapil said.

Sharing a piece of suggestion for fans, Kapil said “don’t drink and drive, and don’t drink and tweet”, when Karan subtly hinted at Kapil’s “midnight tweets” once, in which he had questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi about “achhe din” and later apologised.

Kapil said, “I feel like Twitter is very dangerous. Mr Modi should introduce a situation where people who sign up for Twitter should be given a legitimate licence. Koi bhi moo uthake aa jata hai. Mai bhi hoon.”

True to his self, Karan asked Kapil, “So what do you for sex?” Sharma felt clearly awkward with the question, and said, “Is this... Koffee with Karan, or something else with Karan?”
