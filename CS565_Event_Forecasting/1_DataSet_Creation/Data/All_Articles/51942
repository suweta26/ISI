1-3-2017 
A general body meeting of the All India LPG Distributors Federation (NWR) was held in the city on Wednesday.

During the meeting which was presided over by Captain K J S Buttar, the distributors raised the issue of appointment of new distributors, as it is severely affecting the viability of existing distributors. A statement said that a large number of distributors of J&K, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh attended the meeting.

Reclassification of urban distributors supplying in rural areas for many years is to be re-designated as ‘Rurban’, as their sales are rural-urban in nature, the statement said.
