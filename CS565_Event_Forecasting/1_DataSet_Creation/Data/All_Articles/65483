14-3-2017 
The death toll has risen to 72 after Saturday’s collapse of a mountain of garbage in a landfill outside Ethiopia’s capital, state broadcaster EBC reported on Tuesday. Many victims were women and children as makeshift homes inside the Koshe landfill were buried in debris. It is not clear how the collapse occurred.

Watch what else is making news:

Officials say they have already relocated hundreds of people from the landfill, where waste-pickers salvaged items to make a living and others found inexpensive housing. Ethiopia has declared three days of national mourning that will be observed as of tomorrow. The first funerals of victims began Monday.
