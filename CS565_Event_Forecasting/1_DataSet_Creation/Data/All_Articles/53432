Fernando Torres, 32, was hit from behind by Deportivo’s Alex Bergantinos in a clash of heads five minutes from time and hit the ground hard as he appeared to have already lost consciousness.

After undergoing a CT scan, Torres tweeted from the hospital: “Many thanks to all for worrying for me and for your messages of encouragement. Has been only a scare. I hope to come back very soon!”

Chelsea FC, the team for which Torres played in between Liverpool and his current stint with Atletico, tweeted its support as well.

“Thoughts tonight are also with Torres. Get well soon Nando, from everyone at Stamford Bridge.”

Players from both sides immediately called for medical attention when Torres hit the ground.

Distressed Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez was seen crying, whilst Deportivo fans gave the former Spanish international a standing ovation as he was carried from the field.

“We are all scared,” Atletico left-back Filipe Luis told BeIN Sports.

“The news we have received until now is good. The most important thing is that Fernando is ok.”

Atletico had to play out seven minutes of stoppage time with 10 men as they had already made all three substitutions.

And the hosts made the perfect start when Florin Andone capitalised on a poor goal kick from Jan Oblak to run through and slot past the Slovenian.

Atletico responded after half-time and equalised in stunning fashion 22 minutes from time when Antoine Griezmann thrashed home a shot from fully 30 yards.
