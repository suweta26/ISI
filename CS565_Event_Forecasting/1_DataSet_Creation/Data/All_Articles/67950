Jharkhand: Woman says father raped her over 3 yrs, forced her to undergo abortions 
16-3-2017 
A 30-year-old woman has accused her father of raping her several times, and forcing her to undergo abortions thrice, in the last three years. Shockingly, the rapes were allegedly committed after the victim got married.

The woman made the revelations before Dhanbad deputy commissioner A Dodde on Wednesday, and sought action against her father – a resident of Nirsa. She also filed a written complaint, which was forwarded to the Dhanbad superintendent of police and Nirsa law-enforcement authorities for a thorough probe.

“My father would rape me whenever he came visiting my in-laws in Jamtara district,” the woman said in her complaint.

The victim’s husband, who accompanied her to the district commissioner’s office, said his job required him to be stationed at Chitaranjan in Bengal. “My wife stayed back at the village to look after my aged mother. Since there is no male member at home, my father-in-law used to drop by frequently,” he said.

The couple claimed that they had previously raised the issue with the village panchayat and submitted petitions to the Nirsa and Jamtara police stations. However, no action was taken because the accused was an influential land broker from the locality.

The woman further alleged that her father threatened to kill her husband if she told anybody about his misdeeds.

Nirsa police station in-charge Parmeshwar Prasad said a complaint has been registered, and the accused would be summoned soon for questioning. “Appropriate action will be taken after the facts in the case are verified,” Prasad added.
