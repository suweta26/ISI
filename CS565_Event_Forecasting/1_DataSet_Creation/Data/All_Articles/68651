Pune: Parents of four-year-old heart patient write to PM Modi for financial aid 
17-3-2017 
The distraught parents of four-year-old Aaradhya, who is suffering from a heart disease, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday seeking financial help for her surgery.

Aaradhya suffers with a hole in her heart since her birth and the surgery for her treatment comes at an exorbitant price. Her parents have written a letter to the Prime Minister, requesting him to help her by explaining her health condition and their financial inability.

Aaradhya’s parents feel that Prime Minister Modi will definitely help their daughter as he did last year with Vaishali, who also had the same problem.

A relative of Aaradhya stated that this is an awareness campaign on organ donation which is necessary in the country.

“We are organising an awareness campaign for Aaradhya for her quick recovery and to garner Prime Minister Modi’s support. This rally will be held on March 19 and I hope more people come in support of her. Aaradhya is currently at home but she has to get admitted in hospital after 15 days for three days. When I got to know that my niece had this problem, I contacted Vaishali Yadav’s parents and took their advice. I strongly appeal to the Prime Minister to respond soon,” said Aradhya’s uncle.

Resonating similar views, Vaishali’s relative, Pratap Yadav, came out in support in Aaradhya.

“Aaradhya needs help and we are all in support of her. I was so happy when Modi ji replied positively to our letter in Vaishali’s case. So that is why I advised Aradhya’s uncle too to contact his office and receive the best of help. Vaishali will also be participating in the rally ‘Save Aradhya’ on March 19.

College students will also be joining the rally that will be held on Sunday.
