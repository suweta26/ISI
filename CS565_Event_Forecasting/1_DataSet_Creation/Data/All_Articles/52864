Second-seeded Rafael Nadal cruised into the quarter-finals of the Mexico Open on Wednesday with a comprehensive 6-1, 6-1 victory over Paolo Lorenzi.

Nadal dropped just seven points on his serve, never facing a break point.

Djokovic wins

Novak Djokovic - seeking to reach his first final at the ATP 500 event - had to dig deep against Juan Martin del Potro to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 over the 2009 US Open champion in Acapulco.

The Serbian star broke in the 10th and final game as he closed out the second-round clash in two hours, 38 minutes to set up a meeting with sixth seed Nick Kyrgios, who saw off Donald Young 6-2, 6-4.

Action on Acapulco’s Cancha Central was to conclude Wednesday with top-seeded Novak Djokovic taking on Argentine veteran Juan Martin del Potro -- with the winner advancing to a quarter-final clash with Australia’s Nick Kyrgios.

Sixth-seeded Kyrgios defeated American Donald Young 6-2, 6-4.

Third-seeded Marin Cilic booked his quarter-final berth with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 victory over fellow Croatian Borna Coric.

Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion, remained unbeaten against his 20-year-old compatriot.

He fired a dozen aces, and broke Coric three times in the match -- including twice in the final set to set up a clash with American Steve Johnson, a 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 winner over American wildcard Ernesto Escobedo.
