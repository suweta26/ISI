I am convinced you have lost your mind, Jethmalani tells HC judge Karnan 
12-3-2017 
Noted senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani has written a scathing letter to justice CS Karnan of Calcutta high court, embroiled in a confrontation with the Supreme Court, calling him a “lunatic” and asking him to pray for pardon for every “stupid action” he has so far indulged in.

A seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar had issued a warrant order, directing Justice Karnan’s presence on March 31.

Justice Karnan had ignored earlier summons in connection with contempt proceedings initiated against him for accusing several judges of the Madras high court, where he had earlier served, and an SC judge of corruption, nepotism and casteism.

Later, justice Karnan ordered CBI to investigate and file a report against all the seven top court judges and Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi.

“I am sorry to tell you that I am convinced you have lost your mind. Your behaviour is that of a lunatic and some day that may be the only defence available to you though with no bright change of success,” the former Union law minister said in the letter.

“As a senior member of the Bar and living in the departure lounge of God’s airport I am advising you to withdraw every word that you have uttered and humbly pray for pardon for every stupid action you have so far indulged in,” he added.

He told Justice Karnan to not “destroy or weaken” the judiciary, which he said was the only protection common people have in the “corruption dominated country”. The SC had on February 8 issued contempt notice to justice arnan and asked him to appear before the top court on February 13.
