10-3-2017 
Sometimes, the most serious topics on live television can turn into the subject of jokes because of unexpected gaffes. As a professor at a South Korean university found out on Friday.

Political science expert Robert Kelly was being interviewed by BBC on the impeachment of South Korea President Park Geun Hye via webcam from his home when his two children burst into the room.

His elder child did a dance in front of the camera, even as Kelly struggled to keep a straight face. Things got more complicated as his second child wandered into the room.

The comical video has since gone viral on social media.

However, credit where credit is due — Kelly managed to successfully complete his interview.
