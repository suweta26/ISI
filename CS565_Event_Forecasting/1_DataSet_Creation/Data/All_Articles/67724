PM Modi attends Rajya Sabha proceedings, first time after election results 
16-3-2017 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the Rajya Sabha on Thursday during the Question Hour for about 15 minutes, his first appearance in the House since the assembly poll results were declared.

As soon as the Prime Minister stepped into the Upper House at 1210 hours, members of the Treasury bench rose. Questions relating to the Prime Minister and his office are slated to be raised in the House every Thursday.

However, some Opposition members taunted him saying, “Dekho Dekho Kaun aaya hai, Hindustan ka sher aaya hai (Look who has come, the lion of India has arrived).”

Modi sat through the Question Hour for 15 minutes and listened to queries raised by members on vacancies in Kendriya Vidyalayas and cases of manual scavenging.

He left the House at 12:25pm.
