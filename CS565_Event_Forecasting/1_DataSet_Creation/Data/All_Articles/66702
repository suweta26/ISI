India and Pakistan have not held any bilateral trade meeting since 2014 and there is no progress on the agreed road map, the government informed Parliament Wednesday. The commerce ministers of India and Pakistan had met in January 2014 on the sidelines of the 5th SAARC Business Leaders Conclave here.

At that meeting, both the ministers reaffirmed the commitment to expeditiously establish normal trading relations and provide Non-Discriminatory Market Access (NDMA) on a reciprocal basis in this context.

“No bilateral trade meeting between India and Pakistan has taken place since then, and there is no progress on the agreed road map,” Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.

The bilateral trade between the countries stood at USD 2.61 billion in 2015-16 compared to USD 2.35 billion in the previous fiscal.
