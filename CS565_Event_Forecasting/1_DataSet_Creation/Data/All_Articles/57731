Begum Jaan, a Hindi adaptation of Mukherji’s stellar Bengali offering Rajkahini, stars Vidya in the lead, a brothel’s madam in Punjab during India’s partition in 1947. Rituparna Sengupta essayed the lead role in the Bengali version and director Srijit Mukherji’s first choice for the adaptation was Vidya.

“There’s something about Vidya’s face, voice and body language. Frankly, if you think of such powerful roles, you can only think of Vidya or Rani Mukherji. Vidya was my first choice. I can’t think of other actors who can pull off this character,” the director told Hindustan Times.

Begum Jaan has been shot in Delhi and different parts of Bihar.
