Isolated incident of cruelty against spouse canâ€™t be ground for divorce: Supreme Court 
8-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that some isolated incidents of cruelty against spouse cannot be a ground to seek divorce and marriage could be dissolved only if such incidents are recurring in nature.A bench of Justices R K Agrawal and A M Sapre also ruled that a husband or wife could not claim for divorce on the basis of incidents which took years before the divorce petition was filed.It set aside the order of a family court and Delhi High Court which had granted divorce to a man on the basis of alleged incidents of cruelty against him which took place a decade before he approached the court for dissolution of marriage. Six years after marriage was dissolved by family court, the apex court allowed the plea of wife for restitution of her conjugal right "A petition seeking divorce on some isolated incidents alleged to have occurred 8-10 years prior to filing of the date of petition cannot furnish a subsisting cause of action to seek divorce after 10 years or so of occurrence of such incidents. The incidents alleged should be of recurring nature or continuing one and they should be in near proximity with the filing of the petition," the bench said.The court noted that the couple had started living together after the alleged incidents, which means that her conduct was condoned by the husband and he could not raise that ground. The court refused to take into account a recent incident when the wife had him in his office in presence of his colleagues."In the first place, no decree for divorce on one isolated incident can be passed. Secondly, there could be myriad reasons for causing such isolated incident. Merely because both exchanged some verbal conversation in presence of others would not be enough to constitute an act of cruelty unless it is further supported by some incidents of alike nature," the court said."In our considered opinion, both the Courts below failed to take note of this material aspect of the case and thus committed jurisdictional error in passing a decree for dissolution of marriage," the court said and set aside the divorce order. It said the couple should live together to take care of two daughters and to bring peace, harmony and happiness in their life."We hope and trust that the parties would now realize their duties and obligations against each other as also would realize their joint obligations as mother and father towards their grown up daughters. Both should, therefore, give quite burial to their past deeds/acts and bitter experiences and start living together and see that their daughters are well settled in their respective lives," the bench said.
