Vice President Hamid Ansari on Tuesday left for home after wrapping up his two-day visit to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, where he attended a summit of the 21-nation Indian Ocean Rim Association.

At the summit, Ansari pressed the countries sharing the Indian Ocean to show “zero-tolerance” towards state-sponsored terrorism and in an apparent reference to Pakistan asked them to isolate the backers of the menace.

He also put forth India’s vision for a peaceful region and seas around it.
