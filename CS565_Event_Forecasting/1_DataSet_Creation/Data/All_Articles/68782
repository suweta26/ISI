17-3-2017 
Following a Kerala high court direction, a Catholic priest and two nuns surrendered before the police early on Friday morning here in connection with the rape of a minor.

On Tuesday, the high court, while hearing their anticipatory bail plea, directed them to surrender before the police within five days.

Only one person, Thankamma, who was also asked to surrender before the police, remains at large.

All the four accused were on the run after the police found they were involved in helping the 49-year-old Catholic parish vicar near Kannur and prime accused Robin Vadakkanchery, who allegedly raped the minor.

Vadakkanchery has been arrested for the alleged rape of the 17-year-old school girl, who gave birth to a baby boy in February.

The first to arrive was Catholic priest Thomas Therakom who headed the state-run welfare committee of Wayanad district, followed by the two nuns, a medical professional Betty Jose and Sister Ophelia.

All of them presented themselves before Peravoor Circle Inspector of police N Sunil Kumar.

The high court while directing all the four to surrender also directed the police to see that after questioning, they should be presented before the local magistrate the same day and should be let off on bail.

Vadakkanchery was picked up in February when he was on his way to Cochin International Airport to catch a flight to Canada.

After Vadakkancheryâ€™s arrest, it was revealed that the incident was kept secret by Therakom and the three women.
