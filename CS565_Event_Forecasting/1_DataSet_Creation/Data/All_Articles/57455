7-3-2017 
Indian share markets may open flat tracking cues from lacklustre trade in Asia and losses at the Wall Street as investors are on edges ahead of US Federal Reserve’s possible interest rate hike and political uncertainties in Europe.

On Monday, Sensex closed at two-year high at 29,048.19 after gaining 216 points or 0.75%, while Nifty ended at 8,963 following approval of two crucial bills by the GST Council on Saturday, paving the way for the country’s biggest tax reform through a Goods and Services Tax.

On Tuesday, Asian stocks were flat in early trade while Wall Street slipped on concerns about US President Donald Trump’s ability to roll out fiscal stimulus.

The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat after gaining 0.36% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.1%, while Hang Seng gained 0.4% and Kospi 0.5%.

On Monday, US stocks fell as much as 0.37% after Trump signed a revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from travelling to the United States for 90 days.

The dollar was slightly up over a possible Fed rate hike in Mach 16, while political uncertainties over the French presidential election roiled the euro.

The dollar edged up against a basket of six major peers to 101.68 after touching one-week low of 101.22 on Monday as investors braced for Fed rate hike at its meeting next week.

On Friday, Fed chief Janet Yellen said that raising interest rates this month would be appropriate, if jobs and inflation data hold up.
