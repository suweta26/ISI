“We have asked for the report. We have not received the final report and full information has not yet come. What can be said from the documents and other material is that he was a terrorist.

“We will get to know who he was linked with after we get the final report,” Ahir, who is Minister of State for Home Affairs, told reporters outside Parliament.

In a statement in Lok Sabha on Tuesday’s train blast and subsequent anti-terror operations in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said NIA will carry out further investigations into the matter.

He said eight pistols, 630 live cartridges, Rs 1.5 lakh, three mobiles phone, four SIM cards, two wireless sets and some foreign currency were recovered from the place where Saifullah lived.
