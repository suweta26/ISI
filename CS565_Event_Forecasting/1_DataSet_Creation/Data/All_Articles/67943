16-3-2017 
Uttar Pradesh BJP chief and contender for chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya was on Thursday admitted to the intensive care unit of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi.

“He had cough, cold and fever and felt uneasy. His blood pressure had shot up. So, as per standard protocol, he was admitted to the ICU,” said Dr AK Gadpayle, medical superintendent of the hospital.

Maurya’s blood pressure has now stabilised. “He will be moved to a ward in the evening. There is nothing to worry about,” said Dr Gadpayle, adding Maurya may be discharged on Friday.

The BJP leader is one of the front-runners for the chief minister’s post in Uttar Pradesh after the party’s landslide victory in the state. The BJP and its allies won 325 of the state’s 403 constituencies.
