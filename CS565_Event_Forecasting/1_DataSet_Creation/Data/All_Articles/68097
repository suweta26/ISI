To celebrate assembly elections victory, BJP gets Tirupati laddoos from Andhra to Delhi 
16-3-2017 
To celebrate the Bhartiya Janata Party’s performance in assembly elections, the party on Thursday distributed laddoos, specially flown in from the Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh, to its leaders in Parliament.

BJP sources told IANS that the party had planned to distribute sweets to its leaders at the parliamentary party meeting that was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to felicitate leaders over their performance in assembly elections.

Someone then came up with the idea of offering Tirupati laddoos, given as religious offering to devotees at the temple, one of the most visited religious places in India. The laddoo, which is registered for a Geographical indication tag to avoid duplication, is prepared in the temple kitchen.

“Earlier, we were planning to distribute sweets but then came the idea of distributing Lord Venkateshwara’s laddoos,” a BJP leader said.

The party ordered about 1,000-1,200 laddoos on Tuesday night, but the temple was able to deliver only about 600.

These were flown to Delhi by Wednesday afternoon, after which four staff members of BJP’s office in the parliament complex packed them in special boxes -- one laddoo in each.

As the laddoos were distributed, BJP president Amit Shah was offered one by Uttar Pradesh unit chief Keshav Maurya in the full glare of media.

Inquisitive reporters asked if it was an indication that Maurya would be the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.

To which Shah shot back, “Keshav ji will decide on who would be the chief minister”.

In a lighter vein, party MP Giriraj Singh said: “Jo laddoo khayega, woh Hindu rashtra ka ho jayega. (Everyone who eats laddoo will be of the Hindu state).”
