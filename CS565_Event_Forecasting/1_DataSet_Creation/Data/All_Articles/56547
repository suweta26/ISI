Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan and more: When surrogacy helped celebs enjoy parenthood 
6-3-2017 
Filmmaker Karan Johar is the latest Bollywood celebrity after Tusshar Kapoor, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan to opt for surrogacy.

The filmmaker has become a single father of twins - a baby boy and girl - who were born through surrogacy and says he is “enormously blessed” to be a parent. “I am ecstatic to share with you all the two most wonderful additions to my life, my children and lifelines; Roohi and Yash. I feel enormously blessed to be a parent to these pieces of my heart who were welcomed into this world with the help of the marvels of medical science,” Johar said in a statement .

In June last year, actor Tusshar Kapoor also became a single parent to a boy, born through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and surrogacy. “I am thrilled to be a father! The paternal instincts in me have been overpowering my heart and mind for some time now,” he had said.

Aamir and Shah Rukh too opted for surrogacy to extend their families. Aamir and wife Kiran Rao welcomed son Azad in December 2011.

Shah Rukh and his wife Gauri Khan, opted for surrogacy for the birth of their third child AbRam.

Shah Rukh Khan has said his son AbRam loves waving to fans.

Actor Sohail Khan and his wife Seema were blessed with a baby boy-- their second child-- through surrogacy in June 2011.

Noted choreographer and filmmaker Farah Khan and her husband Shirish Kunder chose to become parents through IVF procedure. In February 2008, Farah, at the age of 43, gave birth to triplets - two daughters and a son.

However, for a single parent, to opt for the procedure may become difficult in future as a new bill introduced in Lok Sabha last year is seeking a ban on commercial surrogacy.
