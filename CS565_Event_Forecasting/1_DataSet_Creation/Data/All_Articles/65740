Mamata said that potatoes would be bought at a rate of Rs 4.60 (per kilogram), which is a remunerative price. “Due to the combined effect of notebandi and bumper production of potatoes, our farmers are forced to sell potatoes at Rs 2.50-Rs 3 per kg. In order to give them some relief, we have decided to buy 28,000 tonnes of potato per month directly from the farmers for mid-day meal scheme and anganwadi centres,” Mamata said.

The Chief Minister also announced that her government would relax norms for farmers in exporting the crop and would provide them a cumulative subsidy of Rs 1.50 per kg of potatoes. “The government will relax its norms in exporting the crop and will provide subsidy of 50 paise a kg for railways transportation and Re 1 per kg for shipping out through ships,” she added.
