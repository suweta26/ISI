Muslim woman trolled online for singing ‘Hindu bhajans’ in reality show 
8-3-2017 
A Karnataka-based Muslim woman was trolled after she sang a Hindu devotional song as part of a reality show.

Suhana Syed, 22, who hails from Shivamogga district, sang the song at the audition of the music reality show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Her rendition was praised by the judges.

However, her performance led to an outburst on a Facebook page called Mangalore Muslims, which said: "Suhana thinks she has achieved something by parading her beauty and by singing film songs in front of men of various communities ..."

The post further berates her saying better than her achievement is that of the "of small children who learn to recite the Quran in six months."

The post does not stop there."Your parents encouraged you to parade your beauty in front of people for their enjoyment. For this, come the day of judgment they will not be allowed to enter heaven."
