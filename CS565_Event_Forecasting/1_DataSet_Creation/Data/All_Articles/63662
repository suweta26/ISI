Srinagar-Jammu National Highway open for one-way traffic 
12-3-2017 
The nearly 300-km-long Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was on Sunday thrown open for one-way traffic, four days after heavy snowfall and rains led to its closure.

Meanwhile, sun shone bright today across Kashmir after the days of rains and snowfall.

“Traffic has been allowed to ply on the national highway after the road was cleared off debris of landslides,” an official of the Traffic Department here said.

He said one-way traffic from Jammu to Srinagar was allowed to ply on the highway on Sunday.

“The stranded vehicles were cleared and one-way traffic from Jammu was allowed to ply,” the official said.

The highway, only all weather road link between Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country, was closed on Wednesday due to heavy rains which triggered landslides at many places in Banihal and Ramban sectors.

Fresh snowfall over the past three days had also added to the problems of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) personnel to make the road traffic worthy.

The Traffic Department official said efforts are on to make the National Highway worthy of two-way traffic as soon as possible.
