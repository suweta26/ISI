Five persons, including a woman municipal councillor, were arrested on Wednesday at Anekal in connection with the murder of BJP leader Srinivas Prasad.

Investigation was ongoing for leads to trace the son of Sorajamma, also allegedly involved in the murder, Bengaluru rural superintendent of police Vinit Singh told PTI.

“Once we get him, we will get to know who was the prime accused, who hatched and executed the murder,” he said.

45-year old Prasad, also known as Kithaganahalli Vasu, was hacked to death in Anekal on Tuesday by unidentified assailants, sparking off protests by BJP activists who alleged it was politically-motivated.

Home minister G Parameshwara ruled out politics being the motive. “Congress and JDS workers have also been murdered.Similarly, BJP workers also have been murdered. So, we do not look at it from a political angle.

RSS has demanded strong steps to stop politically-motivated killings.
