Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav defended his son and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav after the party’s humiliating loss in the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, saying “no one person is responsible for the defeat”.

“No one person is responsible for the defeat. We failed to convince voters,” Mulayam, who was ousted by Akhilesh as party chief after the power tussle in the family, told reporters in Etawah.

“Everyone is responsible for the loss. A single person cannot be blamed,” he said on arriving at Saifai, his native village, for Holi.

“It was people’s inclination towards BJP as it has made a lot of promises. Let us see how many promises they fulfil,” Mulayam said.

Mulayam’s brother Shivpal, who had fallen out with Akhilesh ahead of the polls, had earlier in the day said the party would analyse the reasons behind its poor performance in the polls.

“In politics, you win and lose. SP has its origins in struggle and we will struggle again and win,” he said here.

The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Uttar Pradesh with 312 seats while its allies Apna Dal (Soneylal Patel) and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party bagged nine and four seats respectively.

The Samajwadi Party was relegated to a distant second with 47 seats and its ally, the Congress won seven seats.
