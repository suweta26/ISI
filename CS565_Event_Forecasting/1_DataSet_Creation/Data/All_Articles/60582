French carmaker Renault launched a new dual-tone version of its popular hatchback called Kwid Climber at Rs 4.30 lakh.

Unveiled as a concept at the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, the new Kwid Climber borrows its body and mechanicals from the standard edition, but looks cooler with flamboyant design cues. It gets dual-tone orange ORVMs, roof rails, wider fog lamp cluster in the front bumper and a silver faux skid plate.

The Climber looks sportier than it is actually-- there’s just one driver airbag.

The Kwid Climber comes with the same 1.0-litre SCe Renault engine launched last year, and is offered in two gearbox options -- a five-speed manual or an Easy-R 5-speed AMT.

Climber 1.0-litre MT – Mileage 23.01 kpl | Rs 4,30,376 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi)

Climber 1.0-litre AMT – Mileage 24.04 kpl | 4,60,376 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi)

So this edition is Rs 25,000 costlier than the standard Kwid RXT(O) trim.

Renault launched Kwid with an 800cc engine at around Rs 2.57 lakh in September 2015. Thanks to its SUV-ish styling and pricing, Renault India has been selling around 9000 monthly units of the Kwid, clocking over a lakh units in seven months.

Last year, after showcasing the Climber and Sports concept models at the Auto Expo in February, the French automaker launched a 1.0-litre in August.

Kwid has been the most successful car for Renault in India, nearly challenging entry segment’s best-seller, Maruti Suzuki Alto, which sells around 18,000 units monthly. The automaker claims to have made 98% of the entry-segment hatchback in India.

The other rivals in the segment are the Hyundai Eon, Tata Tiago and the Datsun redi-Go.

At the Geneva Motor Show, Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn said Tata Nano inspired the making of Kwid, and that only after 1,00,000 units of the hatch were sold, Renault India started making money.

Renault also facelifted the Duster SUV last year, and is expected to launch another crossover Kaptur in India in this fiscal. Riding on the success of Kwid, Renault is today the biggest European carmaker in India, only behind Maruti Suzuki India and Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
