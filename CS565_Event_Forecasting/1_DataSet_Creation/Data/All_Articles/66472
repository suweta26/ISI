Crocs may “make in India” if GST rates are favourable for footwear sector 
15-3-2017 
The US-headquartered footwear brand Crocs will look at manufacturing its products locally if the much awaited Goods and Service Tax is favourable for the footwear sector.

“We do have business plans in place based on certain assumptions on GST (rates). If it is favourable, we are going to plan manufacturing products in India. We will take decision in 6-8 months,” Crocs India Managing Director Deepak Chhabra told PTI.

He further said: “At present, there is no incentives for manufacturing locally. VAT rates for footwear are much higher than apparels. Unless there is benefit of making in India, there is no point in doing it.”

At present, Crocs India sources 100 per cent of its finished products from its global manufacturing hub in China and Vietnam.
