The vigilance cell of the High Court, that works as a police station to probe case against judicial officers across the state, had lodged the FIR against then Judicial Magistrate First Class A D Acharya, posted at Shihor in Bhavnagar and P D Inamdar, posted at Jamkhambaliya in Jamnagar along with clerk B G Prajapati, stenographer B D Srimali and eight others in 2015.

The FIR alleged that the two judges posted at Vapi JMFC court in Valsad were captured on camera. The recordings, in audio and video, revealed that the accused judges were found “negotiating” over phone in order to favour the lawyers. Following the FIR, the two judges were suspended and subsequently arrested. Earlier, the court had criticised the vigilance cell for not investigating the case properly. The vigilance cell officer had replied that the question of remand of the judges didn’t arise in view of CDs which revealed that “there is a demand of bribe but actual money being given cannot be seen.”
