Depicting Anglo-Sikh wars through 3D technology in UK 
9-3-2017 
A unique exhibition on the lesser known history of Anglo Sikh wars in the mid-19th century using augmented reality technology opens this week in the east Midlands town of Leicester, bringing the conflicts to life through artefacts captured by the British.

Titled ‘Anglo Sikh Wars: Battles, Treaties and Relics 1845-1849’, the exhibition supported by the local council runs from March 11 until June 4. The artefacts modelled on 3D include swords, manuscripts, paintings, other battlefield objects – and the Kohinoor diamond.

The series of conflicts between the East India Company and the erstwhile Sikh empire are grouped under the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46) and the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49). The conflicts ended in the defeat of the Sikh armies and the annexation of Punjab in 1849.

The exhibition programme includes lectures and workshops by military historians, researchers and experts from the Victoria & Albert Museum.

Gurinder Singh Mann, head of the Sikh Museum Initiative, told the local media: “The Anglo Sikh Wars brought into conflict the Sikh empire and the East India Company, and culminated in a bloody series of battles that lasted four years.”

“This exhibition will bring to light the most important aspects of those forgotten wars and take visitors on a unique journey through a vital piece of history for both communities. As well as rare paintings and portraits, visitors of all ages will have an opportunity to engage with all aspects of the war through interactive displays and exhibits.”

Assistant lord mayor of the Leicester city council, Piara Singh Clair, said: “We are delighted to support the Sikh Museum Initiative with this exhibition, which has been supported by the heritage Lottery Fund. The team have worked really hard to create a first- class experience which will be well worth a visit.”
