The student wing of the Dravida Kazhakam (DK) flagged off a state wide campaign against the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) in Tamil Nadu on Saturday. The campaigners started off from Sundarapuram near Periyar’ statue.

The campaign was flagged off by the Dravida Kazhakam state general secretary, Jayakumar and 25 persons took part in the event on 10 two-wheelers and a car led by the student wing’s joint secretary T Kamaraj.

The NEET exam has been opposed by almost all political parties in the state, including the DK. Their concern was largely on the rural students who would be affected by the turn of events and would face more difficulty if they wished to gain admission to medical colleges.
