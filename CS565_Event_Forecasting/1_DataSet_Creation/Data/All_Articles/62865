11-3-2017 
Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan today revealed that money does not motivate him, but he loves giving back to society by way of investing in start-ups and businesses wedded to “philosophy and values.”

“My motivation is not money.. but love to contribute to the world by way of investing in startups and businesses wedded to amazing philosophy and values,” he told a business news channel, here.

The Kaabil-star announced that very soon e-commerce giant Myntra will tie-up with HRX inner wear and sunglasses, his own casual wear brand, besides pushing hard to unveil the women and kids line.

To a query on the growth of HRX brand in terms of scalability and extensions after becoming a Rs 120-crore brand, he said, “It is an open space... very soon we will be getting into inner wear, sunglasses, that is what we have been discussing. We are also considering something offline this year.”

“We are excited about the women’s and kids’ line.. I am going to push hard for the kids’ line.. Definitely, we should be doing it, it is a huge space,” he added.

On investment plans, the 43-year-old actor said he has decided to collaborate with former Flipkart executive Mukesh Bansal.

Talks are also on for investment in CureFit, a healthcare startup founded by Bansal and Ankit Nagori, who have so far raised from investors like Kalaari Capital, Accel Partners and IDG Ventures, he added.

Making a fortune through his HRX brand was much more satisfying than making it through films, he opined.

Asked whether he is concerned about the sales target, Roshan replied in the negative and said, “I am not worried as much as the normal person, but concerned about finding right partners and people to sell my vision and philosophy,” he said.
