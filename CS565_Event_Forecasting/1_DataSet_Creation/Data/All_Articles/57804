India beat Australia by 75 runs to level the four-Test series 1-1 in Bangalore on Tuesday. Defending a modest 187-run total, the hosts were on top of their bowling game and bundled out the visitors for 112. R Ashwin was pick of the bowlers with figures of 6/41, and got good support from other bowlers.

With Steve Smith and Shaun marsh in the middle, visitors were in a commanding situation before pacer Umesh Yadav got the Australian skipper leg-before. After Smithâ€™s dismissal, it was just a walk in the park for the batsmen as India got seven wickets for just 38 runs.

Ashwin, took six wickets for 41 runs, and by doing so he claimed his 200th Test wicket on Indian soil. It is Ashwinâ€™s 25th five-wicket haul. While leg-spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who got six wickets in the first innings, dismissed Steve Oâ€™Keefe leg-before.

For Australia, David Warner, Steve Smith and Handscomb got off to starts but were unable to see the side through.

Hereâ€™s a look at who said what about Indiaâ€™s win on Twitter:
