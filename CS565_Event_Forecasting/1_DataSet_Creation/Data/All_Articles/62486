The new US administration under President Donald Trump has so far not announced any comprehensive policy changes impacting high-skill visa programmes, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has said.

She was replying to a written question in the Rajya Sabha yesterday on the impact of new visa and travel policy of the US on Indian professionals.

She also said the government has been engaging with the US administration and the US Congress at the senior levels regarding movement of skilled professionals.

Asked about the foreign aid received or donated by India, Swaraj said India has been providing more aid to foreign countries than it has been receiving annually in the last three years.

As against Rs 2,150.52 crore received by it, India has given Rs 4,478.84 crore to other countries, the minister said.
