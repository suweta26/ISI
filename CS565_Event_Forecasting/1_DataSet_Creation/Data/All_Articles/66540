Two days after a 28-year-old Dalit student of Jawaharlal Nehru University allegedly hanged himself at his friend’s house in south Delhi’s Munirka, a case of abetment to suicide was registered today. The deceased Muthu Krishnan, who had named himself ‘Krish Rajini’ on Facebook, allegedly hanged himself at his South Korean friend’s house in Munirka using a blanket on March 13.

“We have registered a case of abetment to suicide and the relevant section of The Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) Prevention of Atrocities (PoA) Act. The case has been registered against unknown persons,” said a senior police officer.

The Dalit research scholar’s body was taken for postmortem to the AIIMS yesterday and the premier hospital had constituted a five-member board to conduct the autopsy and issued direction for videography of the procedure that is being carried out today.
