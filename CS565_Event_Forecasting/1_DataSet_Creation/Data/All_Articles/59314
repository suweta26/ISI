Three are still on the run.On October 11, 2007, at about 6.14 pm during Roza Iftaar, a powerful bomb went off in the compound of dargah Sharif, Ajmer, which killed three persons and wounded 15.According to the chargesheet, a section of radicalised Hindus associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh conducted the blasts at Ajmer dargah and Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad in retaliation for the 2002 attack on the Amarnath Yatra and the Raghunath temple in Jammu, allegedly by Muslim terror outfits.The blast was caused allegedly to stir communal disharmony, insult the religious feelings and incite riots during the month of Ramzan.The Rajasthan Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) filed a chargesheet against three accused persons on October 20, 2010 before the chief judicial magistrate court in Ajmer. But, later, the NIA took over the investigation from Rajasthan ATS on April 1, 2011.
