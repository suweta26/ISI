One person was killed and two others were injured when a wall collapsed during a fire in a unit of Dishman Pharma near here on Wednesday, fire officials said.

“A fire broke out at the processing unit of the chemical plant of Dishman Pharma at Sanand GIDC. The blaze caused a blast,” chief fire officer MF Dastur said.

“When people were rushing out of the unit after the blaze, a wall came crashing down, trapping three persons. One of them died on the spot, while the two others escaped with injuries,” he said.

“The fire was possibly caused because of some chemical reactions going wrong in the mixing unit, but exact cause is yet to be ascertained,” Dastur said.

Fourteen fire tenders -- 10 from Ahmedabad and fours from nearby towns of Sanand, Bavla and Dholka -- took nearly 90 minutes to douse the flames, he added.
