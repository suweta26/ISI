A citizen of India who received US asylum and lived in Nevada is facing up to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to plot terror strikes in his home country on the border with Pakistan. Balwinder Singh’s sentencing is scheduled Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Reno.

Prosecutors say he worked with two groups trying to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region. They say he sought asylum in San Francisco using a false identity to elude Indian authorities when traveling back to his home country.

The government is seeking the maximum penalty of 15 years in prison with the possibly of lifetime supervision upon his release. Singh’s lawyers say he was tortured by Indian government officials and was never a threat to the US.
