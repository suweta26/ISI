Roger Federer defeats Stan Wawrinka to claim fifth Indian Wells Masters title 
20-3-2017 
Roger Federer claimed his fifth ATP Indian Wells Masters title on Sunday, continuing his career resurgence with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over compatriot Stan Wawrinka.

Federer, sidelined for around six months after knee surgery last year, returned to win his 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.

With Sunday‚Äôs triumph in the all-Swiss final, Federer joined Novak Djokovic as the only men to win five Indian Wells titles, adding to those he won in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012.

At 35, Federer is also the oldest ATP player to win one of the elite Masters titles, surpassing Andre Agassi who was 34 when he won in Cincinnati in 2004.

While Federer had won 19 of 22 prior meetings with Wawrinka, he noted that his compatriot would be no easy mark as he played his first tournament in America since winning the US Open in September.

But Federer claimed a tightly contested first set with a break in the 10th game, pushing Wawrinka into a forehand error to end a tense rally for a set point, on which Wawrinka sent another forehand long.

Wawrinka responded immediately with a break to open the first set -- after Federer had held all 42 of his service games in the tournament to that point.

He had saved the lone break point he faced against Rafael Nadal in the fourth round, but sent a backhand long on break point to give Wawrinka the advantage in the set.

Wawrinka then withstood two break points to hold for a 2-0 lead, which proved short-lived as Federer won the next three games to take a 3-2 lead.

Finally Wawrinka found himself serving to save the match. A backhand into the net gave Federer a chance, and he seized it with a volley winner.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost some tough ones against you, but when you played the final in Australia, I was your biggest fan,‚Äù a choked up Wawrinka told Federer at the trophy ceremony. ‚ÄúSo congratulations on your comeback and congratulations on today.‚Äù
