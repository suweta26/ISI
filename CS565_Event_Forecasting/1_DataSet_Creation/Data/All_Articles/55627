Eyeing to regain confidence of other international teams and bring cricket back in the country, Pakistan Cricket Board decided to host the Pakistan Super League 2017 final between Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi in Lahore. Despite many international players ‚Äî Kevin Pietersen, Luke Wright, Tymal Mills, Rilee Rossouw ‚Äî pulling out of the match, PCB hopes their decision of hosting the final encounter will be an opportunity to show that the country is safe to resume international cricket.

Shahid Afridi, who plays for Peshawar Zalmi, will miss the match due to a hand injury. After four key players declined to travel to Pakistan due to security fears, five new international players are likely to join Quetta.

With former cricketers like Imran Khan, Shoaib Akhtar criticising the move, fans have welcomed PCB‚Äôs move of hosting the final match at the Gaddafi Stadium. Even the foreign commentators have backed out from travelling for the final. Pakistan has not hosted any international team since the terrorist attack on Sri Lankan bus in 2009.
