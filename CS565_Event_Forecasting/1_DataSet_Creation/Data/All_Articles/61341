“The competent authority has approved the assignment of additional charge of the post of Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, to Pradeep Kumar Pujari IAS (GJ: 1981), Secretary, Ministry of Power, with immediate effect and until further order,” an Appointments Committee of the Cabinet said in an order.

Deepak’s transfer order was issued when he was in Barcelona attending the Mobile World Congress in his capacity as telecom secretary.

Deepak will join as India’s permanent ambassador to the World Trade Organisation from June 1. Pujari, who has earlier been a special secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, is set to retire in June this year.
