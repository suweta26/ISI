20-3-2017 
AB Volvo chief Martin Lundstedt called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the PMO said on Monday, weeks after a meeting with heads of two Japanese auto giants Toyota and Suzuki to discussed Make in India.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky also met Modi on Monday, the PMO said in a series of tweets.

The PMO did not elaborate what was discussed in the two meetings.

However, the meeting of Lundstedt, the Volvo group president and CEO, with Modi assumes importance in the wake of the government’s focus on Make in India to draw heavy doses of foreign direct investment.

On March 9, Toyota president Akio Toyoda and Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki met Modi to discuss future technological development and plans for Make in India.

The Toyota-Suzuki business partnership and future technological developments came up for discussion.

The partnership of the two Japanese firms will promote Make in India, and contribute to employment generation. “It also opens up scope for export of new technology cars from India,” a PMO statement said.
