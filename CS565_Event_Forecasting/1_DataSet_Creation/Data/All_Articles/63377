Rio de Janeiro has said it plans to vaccinate the state’s entire population against yellow fever in response to an outbreak that has killed at least 113 people around Brazil. Although Rio has not registered any cases, it is close to where the disease has taken hold in neighboring Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Sao Paulo states. The aim is “to expand the strategy of vaccination as a preventative measure,” the Rio health department said in a statement Saturday.
