Mallya in more trouble, non-bailable warrant, extradition order issued for tax default 
17-3-2017 
A magisterial court in Mumbai on Friday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant and an extradition order against businessman Vijay Mallya in a service tax default case.

The court also issued an NBW against Sanjay Agarwal, erstwhile CEO of Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines.

“The Esplanade metropolitan magistrate’s court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya, to be executed through the ministry of external affairs, and also an extradition order,” said Service Tax department counsel Advait Sethna.

Mallya owes over Rs 100 crore to the department as of now, he said.

India has an extradition treaty with the UK -- where Mallya is believed to be staying -- and therefore the court’s order can be executed by the concerned authorities, the lawyer said.

The Service Tax department had issued a notice to the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines for dues of Rs 87.5 crore in 2011-12.

The airline collected service tax from passengers but did not deposit it with the department, it said.

“Mallya and Kingfisher CEO Sanjay Agarwal admitted the demand, but the company did not pay up the dues,” said Sethna.

The department then moved the court for issuance of an NBW and an extradition order.

In April 2016, a special court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act cases too had issued an NBW against Mallya, while in January this year a CBI court issued an NBW against the beleaguered liquor baron in an IDBI loan default case.
