16-3-2017 
External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday sought details from India’s High Commissioner in Pakistan over reports that an Indian woman from Hyderabad was stranded in the country and was being allegedly harassed by her husband.

According to reports, 44-year-old Mohammadi Begum from Hyderabad was stranded in Pakistan and called her father saying that she was being harassed by her 60-year-old Pakistani husband in Lahore.

She married Muhammad Younis, who concealed his actual nationality and claimed to be from Oman, in 1996, the reports said.

“I have asked for a report from Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan,” Swaraj tweeted.

Her tweet seeking a report from High Commissioner Gautam Bambawale came after Amjadullah Khan Khalid of Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT), a political party in Telangana, drew her attention to the plight of the woman.

He appealed to Swaraj to help the woman in returning to India.
