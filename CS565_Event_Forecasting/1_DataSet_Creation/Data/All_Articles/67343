Govt denies report of cops beating jawan as Congress seeks action 
16-3-2017 
Congress on Wednesday alleged in the Gujarat Assembly that the state government had not taken any action against the policemen who allegedly beat up an Army jawan in Botad district.

However Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said it was the Army jawan and his friends who attacked the policemen at Ranpur police station on February 28.

Congress MLA Punja Vansh raised the issue.

“The written reply of the minister is not true. This is a matter concerning those who are guarding our nation...He was thrashed in such a brutal manner that he was admitted to hospital,” said Vansh.

No action was taken against the policemen, he alleged.

Jadeja however defended the police.

“On the night of February 28, Ranpur station’s sub-inspector (PSI) stopped a bike as it had three people on it. When the PSI asked for license, Ashwinbhai, who serves in the Army, misbehaved with him. Ashwinbhai was served a memo as the bike did not have registration number,” said Jadeja.

“After some time, Ashwinbhai, another Army personnel Mahesh Jesinghbhai and their friends stormed into the police station and attacked some of the policemen. Five of them were arrested and presented before a magistrate who granted them bail,” said the minister.

None of the Army personnels complained to the magistrate about thrashing by the police, Jadeja said, adding that even the doctor’s certificate said they had not been assaulted.

“Mahesh had even bitten a constable’s hand,” the minister said, adding that Mahesh got admitted to a hospital after getting bail and alleged that he had been beaten up. A non-cognisable offence was lodged against the policemen based on his complaint.
