Even after retiring from the game for more than 13 years now, former Australian captain Steve Waugh has been a frequent traveller to India.

His involvement with various charity works, including the Steve Waugh Foundation that he set up in 2009 and as part of expert panels has brought him back to this part of the world quite often.

However, on Tuesday, he visited Varanasi for a completely different cause — to scatter the ashes of his friend, a Sydney-based shoe-shiner. “It was a lifetime opportunity for me and I really wanted to visit that city. It has a very spiritual feeling. To have the honour and privilege of scattering the remains of Brian (Rudd), I feel great about it. He had a very tough life and didn’t have a family. His last wish was to have ashes scattered in the Ganges. I am very glad to have done something for him and it was a celebration of his life,” India Today quoted Steve Waugh as saying.

Waugh, who is associated with Udayan Foundation back in Kolkata, played his last Test back in 2004 when India drew the four-match series 1-1 in Sydney. He also has an institute, the Steve Waugh Foundation, to support children with rare diseases back in Australia.
