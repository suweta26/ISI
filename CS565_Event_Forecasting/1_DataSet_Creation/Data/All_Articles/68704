India has asked Pakistan for an update on the whereabouts of two Muslim clerics from Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah who have gone missing in Karachi, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said on Friday.

Asif Nizami, 82, and Nazim Ali Nizami, 66, had gone to Lahore on a pilgrimage to the dargah of Khwaja Fariduddin Masud Ganjshakar, popularly known as Baba Farid. Both are members of the Sajjada-e-Nashin (hereditary administrator) family of the dargah.

But the duo went missing after landing in Karachi airport from Lahore, Swaraj said in a series of tweets.

We have taken up this matter with Government of Pakistan and requested them for an update on both the Indian nationals in Pakistan./4 — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) March 17, 2017

Asif’s family said the two men left for Pakistan for March 6 and had their return flight scheduled on Thursday, which they failed to make. “My father was visiting Pakistan after 35 years. Since he is old, Nazim went along with him. We last spoke to them at 4 pm on Wednesday, when they had visited Baba Fareed’s dargah,” said Amir, son of Asif Nizami.

After visiting Dargah, they had shared their photos on WhatsApp. They were supposed to go to Karachi from Lahore. Asif’s sister lives in Karachi and he was going to meet her.

“We are trying to contact them. We will try to meet the Union home minister and the external affairs minister,” said a relative.
