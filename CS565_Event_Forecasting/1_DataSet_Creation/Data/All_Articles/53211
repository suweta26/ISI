The Kerala Economic Review of 2016 said 56 per cent of economic activity in the state was severely affected by demonetisation.

The review, placed before the Assembly on Thursday, said cash transactions were predominant in the state’s economy, particularly in the unorganised and the traditional sectors.

Cash-intensive sectors such as retail, hotel and transport account for over 40 per cent of the state’s economy, and the primary sector accounts for another 16 per cent of the economy. Thus, 56 per cent of the economy was immediately affected by the demonetisation, said the report.

Demonetisation hit revenue from tourism and reduced flow of remittance. Demonetisation affected remittances because of difficulties in withdrawal from banks, the report said.

The RBI decision to keep cooperative banks out of the note exchange process damaged the reputation of the institutions, which handle 60 per cent of deposits, the report said.
