Interestingly, the successor to the Mi 5 is said to have a rear camera similar to that of the Xperia XZ Premium, meaning a 19MP shooter which can shoot 960 fps slow motion videos at 720p.

The Mi 6 is expected to launch in three variants. The entry-level model will come with 4GB RAM with 32GB internal memory. The mid-end variant will have 4GB RAM with 64GB internal memory, while the top-end model with the ceramic body will come with 6GB RAM with 128GB of internal memory. The pricing of the Mi 6 will apparently start at CNY 1999 (or approx Rs 19,399). The variant with the ceramic body is said to be priced at CNY 2500 (or approx Rs 24,500).

Xiaomi is going through a tough phase, especially after the high-profile exit of Hugo Barra last month. Once the top-ranked smartphone maker, Xiaomi has fallen from the numero uno position in its home market. The success of the Mi 6 is crucial for the company which is facing intense competition from Oppo, Vivo and Huawei.
