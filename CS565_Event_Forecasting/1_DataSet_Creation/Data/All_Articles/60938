China says more than 20,000 people from neighboring Myanmar have fled across the border into China after months of violence between ethnic rebel groups and government forces, including fighting this week that killed at least 30 people. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that China condemns the fighting in northern Myanmar and calls for an immediate cease-fire.
