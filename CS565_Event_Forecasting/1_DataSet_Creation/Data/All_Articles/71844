“It’s a joke. I feel sad that the glorious history, tradition and contribution of the association to Indian cricket went unnoticed,” the former Team India director was quoted by a national daily on Sunday.

According to the new rules laid down, Mumbai would now get to vote only once in three years, with Maharashtra getting the full member status. The same would be applicable for Vidarbha, the third association from the state.

The clause, that clarifies the move in the new constitution, stated: “Each state shall be represented by a state cricket association duly recognised by the BCCI and such associations shall be Full Members. No State shall have more than one Full Member at any given point of time.”

Mumbai has been one of the most dominant sides in domestic cricket with 41 Ranji Trophy titles to their name. However, Mumbai weren’t the only ones to be affected by the move. Gujarat, Baroda and Saurashtra too will now get to vote once in three years.

But there was good news for cricket lovers in the North-East with Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim getting recognized as full members.

The constitution was finalsed by the Committee of Administrators (CoA), which was appointed by the apex court to carry out the reforms suggested by the Lodha Committee.
