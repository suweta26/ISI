Jeffrey Archer - Authors and their favourite books 
6-3-2017 
Author of 15 books, Member of Parliament and former bureaucrat, Dr Shashi Tharoor is said to be an "eclectic reader". So in a recent interview when we asked Dr Tharoor to tell us his personal favourite books and the ones which he would recommend others to read, no wonder, his list was endless! "Gosh, there are too many! I still enjoy the classics, from the Mahabharata to Shakespeare, from Kalidasa to Dickens. I’m a rather eclectic reader who loves P.G. Wodehouse and Gabriel Garcia Marquez almost equally. And there’s terrific work being done by a lot of Indian writers, both in English and in Indian languages (which are benefitting from increasingly readable translations). There’s just so much to read that you can’t go wrong wherever you start!," he said.
