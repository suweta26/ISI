The murder of intellectuals Kalburgi, Pansare and Dabolkar have shown total insensitivity to difference of opinion, said Dr Gurcharan Kaur Kochar, president, Punjab Istri Sabha. Educational institutes are a place of learning therefore different opinions must be debated there, said Dr Arun Mitra, member, CPI. Those who addressed the gathering include Dr Balbir Shah, retired professor, DMC, Jit Kumari, Punjab Istri Sabha, Ludhiana, Depak Kashyap, convener, AISF, Ludhiana, Kunwar Ranjan, Ramesh Rattan, Dr Gulzar Pandher, M S Bhatia and Gurnam Sidhu.
