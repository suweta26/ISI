4-3-2017 
Mohun Bagan succumbed to their first defeat of this I-League as Churchill Brothers came from behind to win 2-1 at the Tilak Maidan where lights went off towards the end of regulation time on Saturday.

Trinidad and Tobago striker Anthony Wolfe (65th) and Chesterpaul Lyngdoh (74th) cancelled out Prabir Das’ goal in the 24th minute to condemn the title favourites to a shock reversal. Bagan, after the result, remained third in the points table with 21 in their kitty from 10 games.

In the 80th minute, floodlights inside the stadium went out leading to commotion. It was learnt that the generator was not working and just when one side of the venue had the lights come on, a complete blackout was encountered again.

After 40 minutes, the game resumed with 10 minutes still to play for.

Churchill jumped to the sixth spot from eighth, having 12 points from the same number of outings.

Churchill made a good start with Brandon Fernandes and Anthony Wolfe linking up well. But Bagan took the lead a minute after Jeje Lalpekhlua came close in the 23rd. A Sony Norde floater from the left was turned in by Prabir without much fuss.

But the match turned on its head after the hour mark when the hosts scored two goals in the space of nine minutes.

First, Wolfe made the most of a defensive blemish to slot the ball past Bagan goalie Debjit Mazumdar while Lyngdoh helped them take the lead with an opportunistic header after Eduardo Ferreira failed to clear Brandon Fernandes’s cross.
