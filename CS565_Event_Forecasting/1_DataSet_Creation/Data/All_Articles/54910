All-rounder Krunal Pandya played a match winning knock of 72 and took four-wickets to power Baroda to top of Group A.

Krunal, in his 72-run knock, smashed eight fours and a six while the left-handed batsman forged a 60-run partnership with Deepak Hooda (24). This was followed by a 48-run stand with Yusuf Pathan (71).

Later, Yusuf and Irfan Pathan (50 not out) helped their side put a target of 233 for Assam to chase in 50 overs.

In their chase, Assam lost its openers cheaply. Rishav Das (44) and skipper Arun Karthik (23) added 44 runs before Pandya broke through Arun’s defence and knocked off the bails.

After Rishav’s dismissal, Assam’s batting order collapsed as the last five batsmen fell for just 33 runs.

Baroda’s spin duo of Krunal (4/20) and Swapnil Singh (3/37) took bulk of the spoils.

Baroda are now on 16 points from five games and have a chance of qualifying for the knock-outs.
