Muslims main victims of terrorism, says Italian President Sergio Mattarella

While threats have targeted Italy, especially its capital, Rome, the victims of most terrorist attacks are Muslims, Italian President Sergio Mattarella said on Thursday.

“Threats have been made against Italy, particularly Rome.

“But we often forget that most of the victims of these cruel attacks around the world are Muslims,” Mattarella told fortnightly Italian Jesuit magazine “Civilta Cattolica”.

For this reason it is mistaken to reduce terrorism in our times to “a war of religion”, he said.

Mattarella praised the anti-terror role being played by Italian police and intelligence services.

“They are working with great ability and commitment.

“Their preventive action is unknown to the public, unseen and untold but it is the most important and precious,” he said.
