Patna University blocks dolphin research project 
19-3-2017 
Indecision over the status of the proposed National Dolphin Research Centre in the state capital and delay over identifying land for it , has put a spanner in the wheels and postponed its realisation.

The initial proposal was made five years ago and the State Wildlife Board, headed by the chief minister, had approved the project and sanctioned Rs 20 crore to the Infrastructure Development Authority to develop the requisite infrastructure for the centre, which was intended to bring together research scholars from all over the country and abroad.

The idea was to set up the national dolphin research centre as an autonomous body spread over two acres of Patna university land , near Patna law college ghat on the Ganga river.

“The proposal is stuck over issues of autonomy. While Patna university wants the centre to function under it, the government wants it to be autonomous “, said US Jha, chief wildlife warden.

“Initially, the university agreed to provide two acres of land for the centre near Law College Ghat. “But its syndicate, at a meeting, rejected the proposal, despite the state already releasing funds for infrastructure,” said dolphin expert RK Sinha of PU. Sinha believes the huge delay has adversely impacted the project.

“There has been no survey of dolphin population in Bihar since 2012. We have not been able to even monitor their habitat,” he said. Had the centre come up, the government would have allocated a budget for the survey and habitat monitoring work,” Sinha added.

Sinha recalled that in the last survey (in 2012), conducted on a 525-km stretch of Ganga between Chausa (Buxar) and Sahebganj, nearly 1,500 dolphins were counted.

The chief wildlife warden said efforts were underway to persuade the PU authorities to release the land for the centre. “We will resume our pursuit in all earnestness,” he told HT.
