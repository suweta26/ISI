10-3-2017 
Indonesian politicians with key roles in President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s governing coalition have been caught up in a corruption scandal in which officials allegedly pilfered more than USD 170 million of government money. The current justice minister, a former interior minister, the current speaker of parliament and governors of Indonesian provinces are among those named in an indictment presented to a special corruption court yesterday as the trial of two interior ministry officials began.

Watch what else is making news:



Indonesia’s anti-corruption police allege that a network of about 80 conspirators and several companies used the introduction of a USD 440 million electronic identity card system in 2011 and 2012 to steal more than a third of the funds. Local media reported that parliament’s speaker and the justice minister denied involvement.
