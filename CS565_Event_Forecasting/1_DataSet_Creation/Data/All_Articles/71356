A final-year engineering student of NIT Warangal in Telangana allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the fifth floor of his hostel building on Sunday evening.

According to the police, the student was identified as Sanketh Kumar Suryavamsi, (22) who was in his final year of Civil Engineering course.

The deceased hailed from Latur town in Maharashtra and his father Satrughna Suryavamsi, is working as a professor in Nanded University.

“We have received information that at around 2.30 pm, Sanketh fell down from the fifth floor of the hostel building where his room is located. He suffered multiple injuries and was immediately rushed to the nearby corporate hospital, where he died after battling for life for nearly two hours,” Inspector of police of Kazipet circle, L Ramesh Kumar, told Hindustan Times.

The body was later shifted to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital for post-mortem.

“We have informed his parents. We will book a case after receiving a formal complaint from them and the college authorities. Going by the information gathered from his fellow students and institute staff, prima facie, it appears Sanketh had committed suicide,” Ramesh said.

College sources quoting registrar Y S Reddy said Sanketh had not been keeping well for the last three days.

“On Sunday morning, he was running high temperature and along with a couple of friends, he went to a local private nursing home for treatment. He returned to the hostel room at around 12.30 pm. He had not taken any food since morning. May be, he fell down from the building because of giddiness,” sources said.

Sources also said that Sanketh was involved in a love affair with a girl. “However, he got upset following the girl’s rejection and that could be the reason for his suicide,” they said.
