OnePlus has put out a teaser on Twitter suggesting a new Blue colour variant of OnePlus 3T might be in the offing. The teaser image has a blue background with the date ‘3/15/17’ written on it in white colour. Apparently, OnePlus has partnered with fashion accessory manufacturer Colette for its new venture.

“Something is about to go down with @oneplus & @coletteparis – stay tuned,” reads the tweet. The teaser could also hint at a new accessory that OnePlus is planning to launch for OnePlus 3T smartphone. Details are unclear at this moment.

Assuming OnePlus has teased a Blue colour option for OnePlus 3T, it is likely to remain exclusive to the 128GB storage variant of the smartphone. OnePlus 3T is currently available in Soft Gold and Gunmetal colour options. While the 64GB variant can be bought in both of these colour options, the 128GB variant of OnePlus 3T is only available in Gunmetal colour option.

It could also mean a new colour ‘dark’ or Black colour variant that the company is working on for OnePlus 5. It could also hint at a limited edition colour option for its current flagship – OnePlus 3T.
