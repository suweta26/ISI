09:00 hrs IST: Well come all to the live coverage of Day 4.

Looking to square the four-Test series, India will look for a lead of at least 250 runs to force a win against the Aussies who will bat last on a wearing pitch.

Pujara and Rahane shared an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 93 to keep alive India’s hopes of a series-levelling win over Australia, giving the hosts a lead of 126 on a see-saw third day.

India’s chances appeared slim when paceman Josh Hazlewood’s triple strike helped Australia reduce them to 120 for four before tea and the touring side looked favourites to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.

But Pujara and Rahane batted through the final session to ensure India will set them a decent target to chase on a difficult pitch.

At close of play, Pujara was unbeaten on 79 with Rahane on 40 to take India, who lost the opening Test of the four-match series by 333 runs, to 213 for four.
