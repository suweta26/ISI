Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal enter Indian Wells third round 
13-3-2017 
Novak Djokovic opened his defence of his Indian Wells Masters title on Sunday with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) victory over Briton Kyle Edmund.

Ninth seeded Roger Federer breezed into the third round Stephane Robert 6-2, 6-1.

The Swiss great, who claimed his 18th Grand Slam title in Melbourne in January, needed just 51 minutes to get past the 81st-ranked Robert in the first meeting between the two.

He next faces American Steve Johnson, who dispatched South African Kevin Anderson 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4).

Nadal wins

A “solid” effort saw three-time champion Rafael Nadal safely through with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Guido Pella.

Launching his campaign after a first-round bye, Nadal was happy to forego the fireworks on a blazing hot Stadium Court and secure a workmanlike win in one hour and 21 minutes.

Djokovic made to work hard

The world number two from Serbia, whose five Indian Wells titles include three in the past three years, had to battle back in the second set against the 46th-ranked Edmund to force the tiebreaker and put it away in straight sets.

“First match played, really a big test,” said Djokovic. “Throughout most of the second set, he was the better player. Just a few points decided that second set.”

Things likely won’t get any easier for the world number two, who faces former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro in the third round after del Potro defeated fellow Argentine Federico del Bonis 7-6 (7/5), 6-3.
