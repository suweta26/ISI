Borussia Dortmund attacking midfielder Marco Reus has been ruled out until the start of April with a hamstring injury.

Reus suffered the injury in his right thigh in the first half of Dortmund’s 6-2 rout of Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Saturday.

Dortmund says he will be out for around four weeks, ruling the midfielder out of the side’s Champions League round-of-16 second leg against Benfica on Wednesday, the German Cup match against Sportfreunde Lotte, as well as league games against Hertha Berlin and Ingolstadt.

Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel says the influential playmaker’s absence is a “huge loss.”
