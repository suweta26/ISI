Oscars to Sholay, Shashi’s everywhere: Anushka Sharma has the funniest Phillauri memes 
8-3-2017 
And the award for Most Innovative Film Promotion in Bollywood goes to Anushka Sharma! For her funny, out-of-the-box approach to promoting her forthcoming film Phillauri which also stars Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma and Mehreen Pirzada.

In a series of Instagram posts on Wednesday, Anushka shared a set of iconic Bollywood posters and pictures with Shashi, her character - a ghost - in the film, embedded in them. For instance, we can see Shashi sitting on the side car of Amitabh Bachchan’s scooter in a still from Sholay and Anushka explains, “Now you know why Veeru is riding on Jai’s back!”

Ab aap jaan gaye ki Veeru Jai ke upar kyon baitha tha. Because #ShashiWasThere 👻 A post shared by AnushkaSharma1588 (@anushkasharma) on Mar 7, 2017 at 3:37am PST

In another post, Anushka shows herself on the stage during Oscars 2017. The accompanying caption reads: “I kept telling them in Hindi that the name was wrong!”

Yeh log mujhe sun nahin paye, main toh kab se Hindi mein keh rahi thi ki naam galat likha hai #ShashiWasThere 👻 A post shared by AnushkaSharma1588 (@anushkasharma) on Mar 2, 2017 at 3:30am PST
