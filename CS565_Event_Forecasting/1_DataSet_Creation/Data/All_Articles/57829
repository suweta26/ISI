Eight passengers were injured when a tube light burst in the last coach of a Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train near Kalapipal, around 80 km west of Bhopal on Tuesday morning.

Two seriously injured passengers have been referred to Bhopal. Two teenage girls and two women are among the injured.

Eye witnesses said the tube light burst with a loud noise and splinters fell mainly on one person and left him bleeding profusely. The person sitting next to him was also injured.

The loud noise created panic as passengers mistook it for a bomb blast and rushed to get out of the train, creating a stampede like situation in which five people were injured. All the injured have been admitted to Kalapipal hospital. The damaged coach was detached at Jabri station.

The railway PRO in Indore said there was disruption in train movement for around an hour.

In Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh home minister Bhupendra Singh said that special medical teams have been sent and an investigation would be conducted.
