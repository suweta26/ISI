NDA ally Shiv Sena Wednesday appeared to be critical of the government’s decision to merge Railway Budget with the General Budget. Participating in a debate on Demand for Grants for the Railway Ministry, Shiv Sena member Shrirang Appa Barne said Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had promised to present report card every year.

“But with the merger, I fail to understand how the government would be able to present report card,” Shiv Sena member Shrirang Appa Barne said.

He also wanted the government to revive the train at Matheran which is a hill station in Maharashtra.

Matheran Hill Railway is a 2-feet narrow gauge heritage railway in Maharashtra which is non-functional. Later, his party colleague Arvind Sawant, while participating in a debate on Demand for Grants on Agriculture, said the government should bring a debt waiver scheme for farmers in Maharashtra who are facing vagaries of the Monsoon leading to suicides.
