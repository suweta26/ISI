“Terrorists do not have any ideology and create disturbances whenever they get a chance. The police is on the job to nab such elements,” he said.

The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad has launched an operation to flush out the suspected terrorist holed up in a house on the outskirts of Lucknow following inputs that he may be linked to Bhopal-Ujjain train blast this morning.

The densely populated neighbourhood has been cordoned off and at least 20 commandos are involved in the operation, police said.

At least eight persons were today injured, two of them seriously, in a blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train near Jabdi station in Shajapur district of Madhya Pradesh, a Railway official said.
