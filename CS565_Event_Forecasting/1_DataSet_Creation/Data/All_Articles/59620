8-3-2017 
A 17 year-old student allegedly committed suicide in Udupi district on Wednesday as he was unable to bear the pressure to score well in the upcoming pre-university examinations.

Harish, a second PU Commerce student at the MGM College in Udupi, ended his life by hanging himself at his house when his parents were away, the police said.

The family members told the police that Harish was doing well in studies and aimed to get the top rank in second PU board examinations.

The pressure to secure the top rank might have forced him to take the extreme step, they said.
