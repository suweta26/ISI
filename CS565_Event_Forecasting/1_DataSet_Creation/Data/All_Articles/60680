Mandatory for scholarships but not passport: All you need to know about use of Aadhaar 
9-3-2017 
Biometric based Aadhaar is envisioned as a single-window mechanism to seek government benefits, ranging from mid-day meals and skill training to scholarships from the next financial year. The decision, activists say, violates a Supreme Court order asking the government to keep Aadhaar “voluntary” for availing entitlements.

In the last month, the social welfare ministries of the central government have issued similarly worded notifications making Aadhaar or enrolling for the 12-digit number mandatory. Most of the ministries have set June 30 as the deadline to submit Aadhaar number or provide an enrolment slip for the 12-digit number. Some ministries have set March 31 as the deadline.

The overdrive to make Aadhaar mandatory is part of the government’s decision to transfer Rs 2.02 lakh crore in 2017-18 to beneficiaries only through Aadhaar payment bridge. And for that, getting an Aadhaar number is necessary.

This would mean that Aadhaar would be a must for a farmer to seek subsidy or any other benefit from the government, a rescued sex worker to enrol for skill training, a pregnant women to get nutrients and children to have mid-day meals in schools.

Reetika Khera, a development economist with the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, said the notifications issued by central ministries were in violation of the Supreme Court’s order which said “Aadhaar cannot be made compulsory for any services to which people are otherwise entitled”.

She also claimed the court orders cannot be superseded by Aadhaar law under which the government has issued the order. The law was enacted in September 2016, a few days before the court asked the government to wait till its final verdict on legality of Aadhaar.
