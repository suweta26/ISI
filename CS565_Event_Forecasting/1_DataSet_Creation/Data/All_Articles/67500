10 books you must read to understand Gay literature 
15-3-2017 
India is still coping with the freedom of gay relationships. While some have comfortably come out of the closet and are living their true identities, there are many who still wear a mask to blend into the heterosexual society to be accepted. It is our responsibility as human beings to accommodate diverse actualities and deal with such issues more maturely. Belonging to the queer subculture does not make someone an outcast. It is high time law makers must realise that admitting oneâ€™s true sexual identity is not a disease but a biological orientation.



We recommend these 10 books from LGBT literature that you must read to understand the sensibilities of the culture!
