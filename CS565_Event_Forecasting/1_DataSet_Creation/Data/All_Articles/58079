He said the case was registered following allegations that Tehsildar Settlement Budgam Rifat Ara and Shah, who was then Nazir in the office of Tehsildar Settlement Budgam, during their posting have entered into a criminal conspiracy and have misappropriated an amount of Rs 12 lakh through manipulation of records between January 2009 and February 2010.
