England and West Indies play the third and final ODI at Barbados. England have already won the series 2-0 and will be looking at completing a 3-0 whitewash over an inexperienced West Indies side. The hosts needed to win the series so as to remain contention for automatic qualification to the 2019 World Cup. Their bid has now been put under threat but the West Indies have had a few positives in this series, particularly the way their bowlers like Shannon Gabriel and Ashley Nurse have played. England haven’t really turned on their brand of attack batsmanship in this match.
