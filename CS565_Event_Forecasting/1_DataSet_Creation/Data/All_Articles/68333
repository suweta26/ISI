A woman allegedly branded her nine-year-old son’s private parts with a hot spoon and tortured him with the help of her second husband in Hyderabad’s Jeedimetla area, police said on Thursday.

The incident came to light after the boy’s biological father Murali Krishna lodged a complaint with police in Jeedimetla, a day after the minor escaped from his mother Anusha’s house and went to Krishna, who is a resident of Sangareddy town.

According to police, the boy was allegedly tortured by Anusha after he expressed his desire to stay with Krishna.

Krishna alleged that Anusha and her second husband, Ashok Reddy, tortured the boy regularly by beating him up and also branded his private parts with a hot spoon, said Jeedimetla police station sub-inspector K Lingya Naik.

Police have booked Anusha and Reddy on charges of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means under IPC and under relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act, and are searching for the duo, who were absconding, Naik said.

Krishna and Anusha who got married in 2005 have two sons, aged 11 and 9.

“However, owing to the family dispute, Anusha left their house along with her two sons five months back, and later married Reddy,” the officer said. Further probe is on.
