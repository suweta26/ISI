Anushka Sharma’s Phillauri is making all the right noise before its March 24 release, ensuring that it is the next big thing to look forward to in Bollywood. The makers have now released a behind-the-scenes video of the making of the song Sahiba.

Phillauri stars Anushka along with Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma and Mehreen Pirzada.

In a long video, Anushka talks about her love for the song and says, “Sahiba is my favourite song from the film. I feel it is special because it connects the film’s love story, which is quite epic, to the legendary folklore of Mirza-Sahiba.”

Titled Sahiba, the song recreates the timeless appeal of the Mirza Sahiba folklore from Punjab, weaving the tale of unrequited love in a musically enticing, contemporary form. Written by Anvita Dutt, the song has a very sufi-romantic taste to it. Romy and Pawni Pandey have lent their voices for the song while Shashwat Sachdev has composed the music.

She adds, “The song shows that love is same in all times, only the expression of the love changes. The lyrics are about longing. I love that line ‘tere bin saans bhi kaanch si kaate kaate’. I think a lot of credit for the song goes to Rumy. His voice takes the song to another level,” she adds.
