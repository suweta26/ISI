NEW DELHI: The Indian government is ready for international collaboration in the field of cyber security and favours handling issues of cyber terrorism, extremism in cooperation with other countries, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday."India is willing to have the widest cooperation across the world in the quest of cyber security," Prasad said at an international conference on e-governance, ICEGOV, here.Cyber crime has been growing across the globe because of lack of international cooperation in this field. As per experts, many countries have been hesitant in signing cooperation agreements to handle cyber-crime because of suspected involvement of their security agencies in cyber espionage. "If internet has to remain powerful, it must be safe and secure. Few people are using digital technology for terrorism, for hatred and for extremism," Prasad said.Speaking on the issue of potential curbs on H1B visa from the US, he said the Government has conveyed its concerns to the US administration."Concerns have been conveyed to the US. Indian IT companies have been servicing 75% of Forbes companies. The whole IT movement is based on sharing and reciprocity," Prasad said.US had last week said it will be temporarily suspending premium processing of H-1B visas from April 3, eliminating the option of shorter waiting period for the programme that helps highly skilled foreigners work at American firms.
