RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch wants Union minister Harsimrat Badal sacked 
7-3-2017 
RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch has lashed out at food processing minister Harsimrat Badal for pitching for foreign direct investment (FDI) in non-food items, along with food products, under the multi-brand retail policy.

In a tweet, Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM, the trade arm of the RSS, said the prime minister should sack the minister for making “an irresponsible statement”.

Badal was quoted to have told reporters on Monday that the decision required a cabinet nod and she had forwarded suggestions in this regard to the Prime Minister’s Office.

The SJM has been steadfastly opposing FDI and has sent several representations to the government to reconsider their stance on the issue.

“It is the BJP’s stated position that they do not favour FDI in retail. After we protested that allowing FDI in food processing will take away jobs, the government assured that there will be a rethink on the policy, so how has the minister made such a comment? The PM should take action,” Mahajan told HT.

He said the argument that allowing FDI in the food processing industry will help farmers get a better deal for their produce is flawed.

SJM also opposed the FDI reforms rolled out last year, which opened up sectors such as defence and aviation to foreign investment.
