NEW DELHI: In an alarming incident of indiscipline on board a warship, four young sailors were airlifted to shore from survey ship INS Sandhayak after they allegedly disobeyed orders and even apparently exchanged a few blows with officers on the high seas.The Navy , on its part, said the "incident of insubordination" had been reported from INS Sandhayak while it ws on a routine deployment off Paradip in the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday."The Indian armed forces are known for maintaining very high standards of discipline. An inquiry has been ordered into the incident because there is no scope for tolerance for such incidents," said an officer."The ship was directed to disembark the personnel involved in the incident to facilitate the progress of investigation before it resumed its assigned task," he added.The four sailors were allegedly disobeying direct orders, including the lowering of boats into the waters from the ship for carrying out different tasks, as well as reporting late for duties. When they were pulled up by officers, they apparently got into an argument and there was a scuffle on board the ship.
