Babri case: SC may revive conspiracy charges against Advani, other BJP leaders 
6-3-2017 
The Supreme Court on Monday hinted that it might revive conspiracy charges against 13 BJP and other Hindu right-wing leaders in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case.

The indication came from a bench of justices PC Ghosh and RS Nariman hearing a petition by the CBI challenging the Allahabad high court dropping conspiracy charges against the leaders, including senior BJP’s LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and Kalyan Singh. They also include several VHP leaders.

The Supreme Court’s observations came ahead of the last phase of assembly polls in the state.

Singh, now the governor of Rajasthan, was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Mughal-era mosque was demolished at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).

The Hindu right-wing says Lord Ram was born at the spot where the mosque stood.

The SC bench also suggested to the CBI to club two cases pending in Rae Bareli and Lucknow and added that the matter will be heard in Lucknow. It posted the case for further hearing to March 22.
