‘Disgusting excuse for president’: Anti-Trump tweet appears on McDonald’s handle 
16-3-2017 
McDonald’s Corp’s on Thursday said its official Twitter account had been compromised after a quickly deleted tweet criticizing US President Donald Trump was sent from the company’s handle.

“Twitter notified us that our account was compromised. We deleted the tweet, secured our account and are now investigating this,” McDonald’s spokesperson Terri Hickey said in a statement.

The tweet, sent from @McDonaldsCorp on Thursday and since removed, read: “@realdonaldtrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands.”

The tweet was also temporarily pinned to the top of the McDonald’s account so that it would be the top message people see if they visited the company’s Twitter profile.

Twitter users were quick to retweet the message.

McDonald’s representatives did not immediately provide further details.
