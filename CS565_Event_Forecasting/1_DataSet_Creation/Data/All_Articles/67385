Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that India is a significant economic partner of the US and hoped to continue the bilateral financial talks between the two countries in the future.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with finance minister Arun Jaitley over phone on Tuesday and underscored India’s importance as an economic partner of the United States, the Treasury Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

“The secretary and the finance minister expressed a desire to continue the robust bilateral dialogue between the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance in the year ahead,” it said.

Jaitley is scheduled to visit America next month to attend the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

The two leaders are expected to meet then.
