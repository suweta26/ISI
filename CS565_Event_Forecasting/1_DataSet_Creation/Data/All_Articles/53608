She is certainly one of the biggest rising actors in Bollywood. Ever since her act as Kangana Ranaut’s friend in Tanu Weds Manu (2011), Swara Bhaskar caught people’s attention and now with a critically acclaimed film (Nil Battey Sannata) and a box office superhit (Salman Khan’s 2015 hit Prem Ratan Dhan Payo), she is going places.

Recent reports suggest she wanted to work with director Aanand L Rai’s next, where Shah Rukh Khan plays a dwarf.

However, she did not want to play SRK’s mom and hence pulled out.

A DNA report said Swara told the director that she loved Shah Rukh and added that she wanted to romance the king Khan, and not play his sister or daughter.

However, Aanand told her that the only role left was the mother’s role and Swara withdrew her wishes immediately, the report added.

Swara Bhaskar is currently gearing up for the release of Anaarkali of Aarah. Though it is a small film, big names like Sonam Kapoor and Karan Johar are promoting it. The film clashes with Anushka Sharma’s Phillauri and hits theatres on March 24.
