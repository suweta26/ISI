Two men shot dead two people and seriously injured a third Thursday at a cafe in Basel, north-west Switzerland, police said as they hunt for suspects.

“Two men came into Cafe 56” around 8.15 pm local time (1915 GMT) “and fired several rounds of shots,” police said in a statement, without providing information on a possible motivation.

“Two customers were killed. Another is in a critical condition.”
