At least 22 people were killed and 40 others injured when a bus veered off a highway in Jajarkot district of western Nepal on Thursday, officials said.

Krishna Chandra Poudel, chief district officer of Jajarkot, said 13 people died instantly and nine more succumbed to their injuries in a hospital in the district.

The bus was going from the district headquarters of Khalanga to Khara, a remote village, when it met with an accident, he said.

The bus was carrying more than 60 passengers while traversing what is considered one of the most dangerous mountainous highways in Nepal. Rescue efforts at the remote side were hampered by lack of light.
