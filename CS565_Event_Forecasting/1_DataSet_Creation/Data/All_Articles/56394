Australian news reports said the man was from Melbourne.Thousands of foreign trekkers hike up to the base camp during the spring and autumn season, when the weather is favorable. The popular trek lasts about two weeks, and the trekkers are allowed only up to the base camp. Only climbers with a special permit are allowed to go beyond and attempt to scale the world’s highest peak. High-altitude sickness is also common for visitors to the area who are not used to the thinner level of oxygen.
