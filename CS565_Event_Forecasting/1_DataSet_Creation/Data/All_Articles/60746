She is now in post-operative care, it said. Before being brought to Mumbai in a specially chartered flight, Eman was confined to her bed and had not moved out of her house for the last 25 years.

After landing here, she was lifted, along with the bed on which she laid while travelling, with the help of a crane and taken to the hospital. The bed was made especially for her travel.

Eman is currently under the care of city-based bariatric surgeon Muffazal Lakdawala and his team.
