Two teenage girls were allegedly gangraped by six men in front of their father in a moving vehicle in Devgadh Baria tehsil of Gujarat’s Dahod district on Thursday, police said.

Five of the 13 people said to be involved in the abduction and rape case have been arrested, they added.

Kumat Baria, Gopsinh Baria and others abducted the two sisters, aged 13 and 15, and their father from his shop in Bhutpagla village on Thursday. The accused allegedly forced them into an SUV and raped the girls, police said.

Four others followed the vehicle on two motorcycles, the victims’ father said in the FIR.

Kumat Baria allegedly told the victims’ father that he wanted to take revenge because his son, who was arrested in a prohibition case, told police he used to procure liquor from Kumat. The police had subsequently filed a case against Kumat, according to the father.

The accused later dropped the two girls and their father near Mandav village and warned them not to go to the police, the FIR said.

Police sent the girls to a government hospital in Devgarh Baria for treatment.

Sub-inspector DG Raval said five people -- Kumat Baria, Ganpat Baria, Narvat Baria, Suresh Naik and Gopsinh Baria -- have been arrested in connection with the incident, while a hunt was on for the other accused.

A case has been registered against 13 people under section 376 (gangrape) and other sections of the IPC as well as under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
