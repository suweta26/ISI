To prevent newly-born cattle from the onslaught of this contagious disease, a special vaccination programme should be commenced immediately, Badal said, according to the official.

The Chief Minister asked the Additional Chief Secretary (Animal Husbandry) and all other concerned to work cohesively on the war footing and ensure to send the complete action taken report to the CMO within a fortnight, he said.
