“The name of the site crops up throughout BKD and hence, the CBFC has asked producer Karan Johar to submit an NOC from the site in question. Only then would they be allowed to retain the name in the film,” it quoted a source as saying.

“A recent legal issue, concerning RunningShaadi.com saw the makers dropping the ‘.com’ from their title and from every mention in the film. The Board can’t allow a repeat of the same tamasha post-certification,” the source added.

Hindustan Times could not independently verify the report.
