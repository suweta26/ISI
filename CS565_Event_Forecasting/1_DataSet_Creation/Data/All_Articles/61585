Meanwhile, the special investigation team (SIT) of Patna police raided the BSSC office on Thursday to collect more evidence against Kumar and Ram.

The SIT had last raided the BSSC office on March 3, but reportedly failed to secure vital clues. The court had permitted the SIT to re-examine documents at the BSSC office with certain riders.

The SIT team spent more than an hour at the BSSC office, searching official chambers of the accused and some computers. However, it was not immediately known if it had found vital clues during the raid. The raid, said an officer, was conducted on the basis of the statement of Niti Ranjan, an IT expert, engaged with the BSSC.

The officer said that Ranjan had disclosed several startling fact, which had to be corroborated. “The SIT is still verifying Ranjan’s statement. BSSC employees at the office refused to speak to the team,” he added.

A police officer said that the SIT had recently raided Kumar’s house at Hazaribagh in Jharkhand and secured some documents and electronic devices which were later sent to the forensic science laboratory, Patna, for examination.

Kumar and his three relatives were arrested from the Hazaribagh residence of the officer on February 24, while Ram was arrested on February 8.
