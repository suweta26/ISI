Assembly Polls 2017: UP, Goa & Punjab has more MLAs without criminal cases

This an interesting insight thrown up this election -- there has been a decrease in the number of members of legislative assembly (MLAs) with criminal records in three of five states â€“ UP, Punjab and Goa -- that held assembly polls this year, according to data compiled by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an advocacy. The not so good news however, is that the number of MLAs with serious criminal charges increased in all states, except Manipur.
