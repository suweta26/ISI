Premier League: Manchester United FC held to 1-1 draw by 10-man AFC Bournemouth 
4-3-2017 
Manchester United FC spurned a chance to move into the Premier League’s top four after striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw against 10-man Bournemouth on Saturday.

The result left United in sixth position on 49 points while Bournemouth, who had Andrew Surman sent off on the stroke of halftime for charging at Ibrahimovic, stayed 14th with 27 points.

Argentina defender Marcos Rojo fired the home side ahead in the 23rd minute with his first Premier League goal before Joshua King, a Manchester United academy product, levelled against the run of play with a 40th-minute penalty.

Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc shone with a string of excellent saves, denying a below-par Ibrahimovic three times before he parried the Swede’s feeble spot-kick after Adam Smith handled Paul Pogba’s acrobatic cut-back.
