Junior railway minister Manoj Sinha said on Friday afternoon that he wasn’t in the race to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, a day before the BJP’s pick for the state’s top job is to be announced.

Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, the three-time BJP MP who represents Ghazipur in the Lok Sabha said he didn’t know of a race for the CM’s position.

State party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya – also seen as a contender for the top job – has confirmed that a CM will be chosen at the party legislature party meeting.
