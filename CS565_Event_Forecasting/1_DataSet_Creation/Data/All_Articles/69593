Prime Minister Indira Gandhi deplored that the opposition parties and newspapers had backed out of the promises they gave the government when the Emergency was relaxed. The Opposition had assured the government that it would not indulge in any violence and indiscipline and newspapers would not publish any news which was detrimental to the interest of the nation, Mrs Gandhi said at Misrikh, UP. Mrs Gandhi said the Opposition had made several attempts at violence before the elections and tried to create anarchy among labourers, students and others. “The opposition parties are also trying to make capital out of the family planning programme by spreading rumours of alleged excesses,” she said.

Vijay Anand, of the famous Anand trio, said the industry was shocked at the fate of Snehalata Reddy. “What has happened to her is happening to the whole industry,” he said.
