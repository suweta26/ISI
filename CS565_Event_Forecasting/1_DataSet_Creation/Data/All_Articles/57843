Gold worth about Rs 13.72 lakh was seized from two passengers at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad while they were allegedly trying to smuggle it, a Customs officer said on Tuesday.

The two passengers, who came together in a flight from Dubai last night at around 9 PM, had concealed a gold sheet, weighing around 235 gm, in a checked-in baggage.

Besides, two gold rods of 227 gm were hidden in a handle of their trolley bag, he said.

The yellow metal was seized after the duo was questioned, he said.

Asked if the two passengers were taken into custody, the Customs officer refused to comment on it but said an investigation was underway in the matter.
