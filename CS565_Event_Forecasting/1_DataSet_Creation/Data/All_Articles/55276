The police on Saturday listed five Catholic nuns and two others as alleged accused in the case of a minor girlâ€™s rape by a Catholic priest of Mananthavady diocese in Kerala.

The nuns and the two others are accused of failing to report the fact that the 16-year-old victim had given birth to a boy last month when she was admitted to a hospital. They are also accused of subsequently moving the infant to an adoption centre.

The police said they will be charged under relevant Sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Fr Robin Vadakkamcheril was arrested last Monday from Kochi on charges of raping the teen.
