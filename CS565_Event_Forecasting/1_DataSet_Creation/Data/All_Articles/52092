Delhi HC to hear plea seeking audit of India Against Corruption accounts 
2-3-2017 
The Delhi high court is likely to hear a fresh plea seeking audit of the accounts of India Against Corruption (IAC), an anti-corruption movement spearheaded by Anna Hazare during 2011 and 2012, on Thursday.

The fresh plea came last week after earlier plea was withdrawn last month as it had wrongly mentioned the names of the contesting parties.

The petition filed by Delhi resident, Chand Jain, sought direction to the government and CBI to take urgent steps and place before the court the audited account of the IAC, alleging that crores of rupees were collected from the public by the movement led by Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal.

It has been alleged that the money collected to lead a movement to remove corruption was used for personal gains of the members of the IAC.
