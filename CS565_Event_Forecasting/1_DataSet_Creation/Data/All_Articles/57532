7-3-2017 
The 87th edition of the Geneva International Motor Show kicked off on Tuesday (Monday in Geneva), with Peugeot 3008 grabbing the ‘Car of the Year’ title.

The compact SUV, with which the French automaker is rumoured to come back to India, was voted by dozens of European motoring journalists.

Other competitors were the Alfa Romeo Giulia, new Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Citroen C3, Nissan Micra, Toyota C-HR hybrid, and Volvo S90/V90.

Peugeot Group CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato hailed the recognition as a “fantastic honor”, saying he believed the 3008’s high-cockpit feel in a car that drives like a sedan put it over the top in the competition.

“(The award) will have an effect on image — this is very important for us. It shows we can do the job,” he added. “Peugeot is back.”

The award came hours after Peugeot’s parent PSA Group bought the European businesses of General Motors -- Opel and Vauxhall at $2.3 billion.

“This is the day we will not forget in our history: The same day, two announcements,” said Imparato.

“This is an alliance of winners,” Imparato added. Opel’s Astra was the ‘Car of the Year’ in 2016.
