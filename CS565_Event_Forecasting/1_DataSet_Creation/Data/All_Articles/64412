Indian cricketers took to social networking websites, Twitter and Instagram, to wish all users a Happy Holi. After BCCI had earlier in the day put a tweet on their handle wishing all fans a happy Holi, players from the Indian team (past and present) conveyed wishes in their own way.

As the world celebrated the festival of colours, our cricketing greats were busy enjoying the festival with their dear ones. Indian skipper Virat Kohli uploaded a video on social media wishing his fans and guided his fans to be considerate towards animals and not to apply colours on them.

While Ajinkya Rahane, who will be playing the third Test between India and Australia, wished his fans as he flew to Ranchi on Monday.

Veteran Harbhajan Singh posted a photo with wife Geeta Basra while Yuvraj Singh posted a video where the left-handed batsman is seen shaking his leg on some Holi song.

Here is a look at some of them
