5-3-2017 
The bullet-riddled body of an intelligence officer, who had been kidnapped over two years ago, has been found with marks of so-called Islamic State on it in Pakistan’s Punjab province. Inspector Umer Mobin Jilani of Intelligence Bureau (IB), a relative of Pakistan’s former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, was kidnapped by armed men in June 2014 on his way to office in Garden Town Multan, some 350-km from Lahore. The body of Jilani was found on the Old Shujabad Road, Multan yesterday. Wrapped in a black plastic bag, the body was dressed in an orange uniform similar to the ones worn by prisoners at the US military’s Guantanamo Bay detention camp. His hands and feet were chained.

“Daesh Al-Bakistan’, ‘Inspector Umer Monbin Jilani, Tareekh Aghwa’ was written on the back of his body, according to official sources. Daesh is Arabic acronym for the ISIS. The message accused him of being an agent of anti-Islam forces.

The Crime Investigation Department (CTD) of Punjab Police had been investigating this case. According to a CTD official, the kidnappers of Jilani had shifted him to Afghanistan the same year he was kidnapped.

The CTD had taken several suspects into custody but failed to rescue Jilani. It is believed that Jilani was kidnapped for his role in the arrest of some high profile members of the ISIS Pakistan chapter. The CTD has killed scores of ISIS activists in Pakistan during the last couple of years and believed to have detained many as well.
