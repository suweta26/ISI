Stop Jats from reaching Delhi, Home Ministry tells states 
18-3-2017 
Ahead of the Jat protests, the Centre has asked police forces of Delhi and its neighbouring states to stop the agitators before they reach the borders of the capital.

In an advisory, the Union Home Ministry told Delhi Police and governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to invoke CrPC 144 to stop Jat protesters, who threatened to stage protests in Delhi demanding reservations in jobs and education, from reaching the national capital, official sources said.

Arrest or detain the protesters much before they enter Delhi, disallow movement of buses carrying the protesters on highways and ban tractor trolley movement, the advisory said.

Akhil Bhartiya Jat Arakashan Sangharsh Samiti has threatened to ‘gherao’ Parliament beginning March 20, to press for their demands.

Top Home Ministry officials also reviewed the security situation in the national capital and neighbouring states in the wake of threat by the Jats.

Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi took stock of the law and order situation in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Wednesday with senior police officials of the four states.

He instructed the officials to ensure peace and prevent attempts to disrupt normal life during the protests.

Samiti president Yashpal Malik had said the Jats riding their tractors and small vehicles, and carrying at least 10-day rations will march towards Delhi on the highways from the neighbouring states.

Jats are demanding reservations in government jobs and educational institutions, besides withdrawing of criminal cases registered against several youths of the community, release of those lodged in jail, and compensation and government jobs to the next of kin of those killed in last year’s agitation.
