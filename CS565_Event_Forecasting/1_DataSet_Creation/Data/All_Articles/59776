The Centre will fast track the process of according ‘skilled worker’ status to over 50 lakh private security guards in the country, labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Wednesday.

Speaking at an event organised by the Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI), the minister said, “The labour ministry will soon call upon state labour ministers and work out the policy modalities for introducing the new labour laws in states that seek to bring the private security guards under the organised sector.”

As of now, a meagre 3% of the total security workforce is covered under this category.

“I will soon call a meeting of all state labour ministers to implement the new labour laws on state level for faster implementation of the policy,” a statement quoted Dattatreya as saying.

Categorising security guards as ‘skilled’ workers and armed security guards and supervisors as ‘highly skilled’ workers will entitle them to a minimum monthly wage of Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000, respectively.

“This will not only bring enhanced wages to over 50 lakh security personnel currently engaged in the private security space, but will also provide social cover to over 2.5 crore of their family members,” Dattatreya informed.

The decision will also enable private security agencies to recruit, train and employ quality workforce for the sector, which has been a demand of all stakeholders, including security agencies and the public.

RK Sinha, chairman of SIS, India’s largest homegrown security service provider, said, “The next move would be holistic involvement of states in the process to bring all security guards under the organised sector. The minister has instilled confidence in the industry by ensuring the government will work on it as top priority.”
