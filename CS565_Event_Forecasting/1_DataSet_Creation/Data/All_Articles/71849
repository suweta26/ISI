“The incident is believed to be domestic”, the police said, while local reports identified the man as an Indian, and the two victims as twins.

The girl remains in hospital in a critical condition.

Detective chief inspector Dave Whellams of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: “This is clearly a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with the family of the two young children. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals, a baby boy sadly died in the early hours of this morning. A baby girl currently remains in a critical condition and is receiving specialist medical care.”

“Whilst we remain in the early stages of the investigation, a man has now been arrested. I would still like to hear from anyone who may have any information regarding this terrible incident.”
