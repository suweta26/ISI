New Delhi: Toyota president Akio Toyoda and Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki on Thursday called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss future technological development and plans for Make in India.

The Toyota-Suzuki business partnership and future technological developments came up for discussion, a PMO release said.

“The partnership is expected to bring together Toyota’s global leadership in technology and manufacturing, with Suzuki’s strength in manufacture of small cars, especially in India. It is expected to enable India to use new technological developments,” it said.

Further, high volumes will enable local manufacture of components required for these technologies.

“Hence, the partnership will promote Make in India, and contribute to employment generation. It also opens up scope for export of new technology cars from India,” the PMO statement said.
