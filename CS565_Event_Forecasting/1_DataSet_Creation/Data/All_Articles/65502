Rajnath Singh says Rahul’s allegations of BJP ‘stealing mandate’ baseless 
14-3-2017 
Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s allegations that BJP was using money to form governments in Goa and Manipur were “baseless”.

He was responding to a query on Congress vice-president’s charges that the saffron party was “stealing” the mandate of people and “undermining democracy” in Goa and Manipur by use of money power.

“These all are baseless allegations,” Singh told reporters outside the Parliament.

“He (Manohar Parrikar) will prove majority in the (Goa) floor (test). He will move the confidence motion within few days,” he said.

Gandhi had said, “In the two states where we won, democracy has been undermined by them (BJP) using financial power, money. That is what is happening. The mandate of the people of Goa and Manipur has been stolen by the BJP.”

He also alleged that Goa governor Mridula Sinha was acting in a “partisan” manner and that a letter was issued in favour of Parrikar even before Congress staked its claim.

In the recently held assembly elections in Goa, BJP bagged 13 seats while Congress got 17 seats. However, BJP staked claim to form the government in the state on the basis of support from 8 other MLAs. Goa Assembly has a strength of 40.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court refused to stay the swearing-in of Parrikar as the chief minister of Goa and ordered a floor test on March 16.
