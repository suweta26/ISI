“Both Modi and Kejriwal engage in politics of false promises,” Gandhi said as he listed poll promises Modi and Kejriwal had made ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha and 2015 Delhi assembly polls respectively.

He said the Congress government echoed voice of every countryman.

Gandhi also attacked Modi over the recent killings of Indians in the US. “Modi ji talks about 56-inch chest, right? When our youth are being killed...why he is not speaking? Because India’s Prime Minister is scared of speaking up (to the US),” Rahul said.
