3-3-2017 
The Russian Defence Ministry says the nation’s top military officer has spoken to his NATO counterpart for the first time in several years. The ministry said Gen Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, had a phone call today with Czech Army Gen Petr Pavel, the chairman of NATO’s Military Committee.

It was the first such high-level contact since NATO suspended a dialogue with Russia in 2014 over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
