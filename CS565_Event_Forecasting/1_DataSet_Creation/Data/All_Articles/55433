At present, some feature phones are already being manufactured in India at Foxconn facility. Mehta said the company is even evaluating development of 4G feature phone.

“We are evaluating all opportunity in the market,” Mehta said, adding India is very important market for HMD Global. “All consumer requirements are fed up to the product team at our company which then develops the final product,” Mehta said.

The company will sell Nokia phones through both offline and online channels. “Whichever channel will help reach us to consumers, we will go with that. We will be channel agnostic both offline and online. We currently cover close to 80,000 retailers but we plan to increase that in the future,” Mehta said.

He said the company is also boosting its after sales service channel and will have direct presence in at least around 250 towns in the country by the time phones are launched.
