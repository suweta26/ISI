17-3-2017 
The government today informed the Parliament that RBI will conduct trials to evaluate the introduction of plastic notes of Rs 10.

In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal said “it has been decided” to conduct a field trial with plastic banknotes at five locations of the country.

“Approval for procurement of plastic substrate and printing of bank notes of Rs 10 denomination on plastic banknote substrates has been conveyed to the RBI,” the minister said.

He further said plastic notes are expected to last longer than cotton substrate based banknotes, currently used.

A few years back, the government had informed Parliament that one billion plastic notes of Rs. 10 denomination would be introduced in a field trial in five cities selected for their geographical and climatic diversity. The selected cities were Kochi, Mysore, Jaipur, Shimla and Bhubaneswar.

Over the years, central banks across the world have been exploring different solutions such as plastic notes for extending the life cycle of banknotes.

Experts say that Australia was the first country to experiment with plastic notes and from their experience it can be concluded that these are difficult to duplicate.

If approved, the plastic notes of Rs 10 will be yet another change to banknotes used in India, after the government scrapped Rs 1000 and Rs 500 in November. This demonetisation move was conducted to introduce new notes of Rs 2000 and Rs 500 with a stated motive to crackdown on black money.

Sources in the government however suggest that it is premature to think that existing Rs 10 notes will scrapped to introduce the plastic notes. “It is too early to predict, but there is no logic to demonetise Rs 10 notes. Instead, the new plastic ones, once approved will be circulated along with the existing notes,” said the source mentioned above.
