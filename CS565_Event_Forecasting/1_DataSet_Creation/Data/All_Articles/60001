8-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: BJP hailed the security forces on Wednesday for timely action to gun down the alleged IS terrorist in Lucknow and said the success of the operation was an outcome of coordination among various agencies.However, the party accused the opposition of playing politics over the encounter and said they should draw a lesson from the way several central and state police agencies worked together to carry out the operation."Opposition parties should learn a lesson from the father of the slain terrorist," said BJP national spokesperson Shrikant Sharma. He said the Islamic State poses a potent threat to India and agencies have again underlined their resolve to finish it."It is unfortunate that some parties are doing politics over it," Sharma said. Noting that the NIA , a central agency, besides Telangana and Madhya Pradesh police coordinated with each other in the operation, he said it was an example of "Team India" spirit which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often spoken about. The suspected terrorist, Saifullah, was killed after 12 hours of operation in Lucknow. He is suspected to be linked with the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain train on Tuesday.
