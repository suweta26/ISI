It was yet another dismal batting performance by the Indian batsmen as KL Rahul (90) was the only one to offer any resistance. On a turning track, India’s top batsmen looked quite helpless against the Aussie spin duo of Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe.

Lyon, the 29-year old off-spinner ended up with figures of 8/50 to become the most successful Australian bowler against India. Lyon (58 wickets) surpassed the previous record holder – Brett Lee- when he dismissed Ravichandran Ashwin to claim his fourth wicket of the match.

The figures of 8/50 were also the best bowling performance by any overseas bowler in India bettering South Africa all-rounder Lance Klusener’s 8/64 at the Eden Gardens in 1996.

Nathan Lyon also proved his control over the Indian batsmen as the off-spinner took the wickets of skipper Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara for the fifth time in his career -the most by any bowler. He also dismissed out-of-form Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth time in his career.

It was a truly special performance by Nathan Lyon on Saturday and if the spinner can claim a five-wicket haul in the second innings, he will go past Steve O’Keefe to claim the best bowling figures in a match in India by an Australian bowler.
