India’s campaign at the All England Championships ended on Friday as both women’s players Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu suffered contrasting losses in London. With the two losing, no other Indian player is left in the competition in any category. Both Sindhu and Saina lost in the quarter-finals.

Nehwal had a close game against South Korea’s Sung Ji Hyun and was leading for most part of both games before slumping to a 22-20, 22-20 loss in the quarter-final. The Indian saved three match points but then failed to defend against the powerful smash of Sung to lose the match.

Earlier, PV Sindhu suffered a demoralising 21-14 21-10 loss at the hands of world number one Tai Tzu Ying in just 35 minutes to crash out. Sindhu looked all over the place in the match and was no match to her Chinese Taipei opponent.

Sindhu’s match against Tai Tza never looked a like going the Indian’s way as Tai Tza took the lead after the interval in first game with some amazing net play. Sindhu was playing catch after conceding the lead. Ultimately she lost 21-14 in the first game.

The second game was completely dominated by the world number one as opened up a big lead. Sindhu, despite her long reach, could defend her opponents drop shots or the smashes. In the end, she surrendered the game and match 21-10.

Sindhu’s right leg was heavily padded around the knee and one could see that she was not forcing herself to pick up shots that were way out of her reach.

Nehwal, on the other hand, had a better chance to win after taking a 17-11 lead in the first game. But Sung bounced back and tied it 17-17 before taking three game points. The Indian managed to save the three game points but it 20-22.

In the second game, it was a neck-to-neck competition as Nehwal and Sung were tied 12-12 and later 14-14 but this was the time when Sung picked up pace and took it to 16-14.

Once again, Nehwal was behind 17-20 with Sung having three match points. Nehwal, after saving all three of them, failed to drop a shot close to the net and hit it into it, and lost the match 22-20 22-20.
