A bench led by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar wondered how a bailable warrant, issued by the HC following Khan’s non-compliance with its order, could not be served on a serving minister. “The court feels you (Khan) are hoodwinking… it (HC) is asking you to appear but you are not appearing. You are such a person that no bailable warrant can be served upon you… if the court wants you to appear, you must appear and explain,” the bench said.

The High Court had ordered issuing of a bailable warrant against Khan on a service petition filed by UP Jal Nigam in 2013.
