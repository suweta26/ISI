Naidu, a former scrap mafia, was shot dead along with his close aide Dharma Rao inside a Trinamool Congress party office in Kharagpur on January 11 last.

During investigation, the police had claimed that ‘supari’ (contract) killers from neighbouring Jharkhand were involved in the shootout and a conspiracy was hatched to eliminate Naidu in an effort to regain lost grounds in the Kharagpur underworld.

With the arrest of Rambabu, a total of 14 persons have now been arrested in connection with the Srinu Naidu murder case. The police had earlier nabbed Shankar Rao, an associate of Naidu and two contract killers Radheshyam Singh and Raju Singh.
