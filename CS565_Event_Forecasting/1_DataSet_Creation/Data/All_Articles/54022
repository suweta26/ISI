On Thursday,Chandrawat had expressed regret over his statement, but said he made the statement as he was agitated over the killings of innocent people in Kerala. Chandrawat had made the statement during a dharna organised at Ujjain to protest the murder of RSS workers in Kerala.

Talking to Hindustan Times, he said, “I express my regret but I still stand by my statement. It was to wake up politicians and the Kerala government from slumber and sensitise them to the killings of innocent people in the state.”
