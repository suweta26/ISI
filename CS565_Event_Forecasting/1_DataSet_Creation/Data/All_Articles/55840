5-3-2017 
Baloch dissident leader Mir Suleiman Ahmedzai, who holds the title of “Khan of Kalat”, met Hamid Karzai, former president of Afghanistan, and discussed ways of highlighting alleged human rights violations in Balochistan at international fora.

Ahmedzai, who has been living in Britain since 2006, raised the issue last week at a seminar in the House of Lords, and later told the news media that he would approach India for help. He called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “friend of Balochistan”.

Informed sources told HT on Sunday: “Karzai is on the same page as Modi on the issue of Balochistan. He has agreed to promote the cause of Balochistan independence and human rights violations there in places where Baloch leaders cannot go.”

Ahmedzai tweeted a photo of his meeting with Karzai, which was held on March 1, with the words: “KhanKalat expressed grief over terrorist attacks in Afghanistan & said it’s all happening from the cradle of terror Punjabistan #Pakistan”.

He also said: “We #Afghanistan people & #baloch work together for our security, freedom, peace, sovereignty and safety.”
