License to Tata group to run Taj Mansingh cannot be renewed: NDMC tells Supreme Court 
3-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday told the Supreme Court that it has decided to not renew the license of Tata group-run Indian Hotels Company Ltd to manage iconic Taj Mansingh hotel in Delhi and that the property would be auctioned.Appearing before a bench of Justices P C Ghose and R F Nariman, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain informed the bench that the civic body had taken a final decision of auctioning the property.The NDMC took the decision after the apex court on the last hearing in January asked it to review its earlier decision to auction the property in light of the opinions given by the Attorney General and the Solicitor General who had recommended against auction.Jain told the bench that civic body was ready to for the e-auction but would wait for final outcome of the case in SC. The court then posted the case for final hearing on March 22.The law officers had suggested the NDMC to negotiate with Tata group to fetch the market price for granting lease to the company to run the hotel and opined against putting the property under hammer. IHCL had completed construction of the hotel building, consisting of approximately 300 rooms, with all other allied facilities and started the commercial operation of the hotel with effect from October 10, 1978. The agreement period of 33 years is reckoned from the said date and the company had incurred an expenditure to the tune of Rs 461.61 lakh.The agreement expired in 2011 and NDMC decided to auction the property, hoping to fetch a better price for granting the lease of the property. The company then approached the Delhi High Court which dismissed its plea in October last year and allowed the civic body to auction the property.Challenging the HC order, the company told the bench that it was ready to pay the market price but insisted that the Hotel should not be auctioned as it would prop up the price to an artificial level.NDMC contended that it was not against the company and IHCL could also participate in the bidding process. It said that auction was the best way to fetch good price for the property. "It is the most transparent method and there is no ulterior motive behind it. We have considered the plea of the company for extension of lease but came to the conclusion that auction is the best way to go forward," Jain had said.
