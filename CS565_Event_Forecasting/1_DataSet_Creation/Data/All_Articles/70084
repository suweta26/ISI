When Harbhajan Singh auditioned for MTV Roadies Rising 
18-3-2017 
It’s one thing to throw googlies at gang leaders, but it takes a lot of courage to face them. And that’s exactly what happened when cricketer Harbhajan Singh decided to audition for MTV Roadies Rising.

Neha takes Harbhajan to task during his auditions.

In a soon-to-be-aired episode of the show’s Delhi auditions, gang leaders Rannvijay, Neha Dhupia, Prince Narula and Karan Kundra will be seen going about doing their job as Harbhajan sprints onto the stage and give auditions. He will behave like a contestant. The gang leaders will test his dancing skills and also his strength by asking him to pick up Neha Dhupia. Bhajji will recreate the Dum Laga Ke Haisha moment with her while also doing squats.

Speaking about the experience, Harbhajan said, “I always thought how does it feel standing on the other side. How do the contestants feel when we ask them tough questions. But now I Know. Meri toh do squat mein hi halat kharab ho gai hain.”

The episode will be aired on Saturday at 7pm on MTV.
