The excavation carried out in the Narmada valley at Mehtakhedi village under Khargone district has led to the discovery of 350 archaeological remains which the experts claim to be 50,000 years old.

“The excavation conducted by Shridhar Vakankar Archaeological Research Institute led to the discovery of 350 archaeological remains which the experts claim to be 50,000 years old,” Anupam Rajan, commissioner, Archaeology department of Madhya Pradesh under which the institute functions, said on Sunday.

“The work to explore micro relics was being carried out by dissolving and filtering the soil obtained from the excavation,” he added.

Rajan said that a team led by the former head of the department of archaeology at Deccan College in Pune Prof Sheela Mishra was formed after obtaining permission from the Archaeological Survey of India in January this year. The team included Institute’s research officer Jinendra Jain, research assistant Dhruvendra Singh Jodha and research scholars of Deccan College Neetu Agarwal, Namrata Vishwas and Garima Khansali.

“The excavation was started in the second week of February by Prof Mishra and the team. Around 350 antiquities were found during excavation. Further conclusions will be drawn after analysing them,” he added. Rajan said the development of human civilisation was studied on the basis of underground deposition, ancient geographical analysis and types of apparatus.
