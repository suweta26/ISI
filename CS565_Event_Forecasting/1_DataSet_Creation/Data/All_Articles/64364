Two women labourers were killed and two other people were injured when they got trapped under a huge heap of mud at an under-construction site in Hyderabad’s Madhapur area on Monday, police said.

The incident occurred around 10.15am, burying two women workers alive while two other workers -- both men --managed to escape with minor injuries. They have been shifted to a nearby hospital, they said.

“Four labourers were working on erection of pillars 40 feet below ground level for a commercial complex when a huge heap of mud (of the retaining wall) caved in and they got trapped beneath it,” said deputy commissioner of police (Madhapur Zone) Vishwa Prasad.

The deceased were identified as A Bharatamma (25), belonging to Nizamabad district, and P Kistamma (45), a native of Medak district, the DCP said.

The bodies were sent for post-mortem examination, and police were in the process of registering a case against the builder.

Hyderabad mayor B Rammohan, who visited the spot, announced an ex-gratia of Rs 8 lakh each to the families of the deceased workers, out of which Rs 2 lakh will be given from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and Rs 6 lakh from the labour department.
