There applies a rule of eating a fruit empty stomach early in the morning. People who have stomach ulcers or acid reflux should not adapt this practice. Also, people with weak stomach functions like toddlers and elderly people should not consume fruits empty stomach. It is because some fruits like citrus fruits, pineapples, cranberries, grapefruits etc. contain acetic acid. This increases the production of gastric acid and can worsen the condition.
