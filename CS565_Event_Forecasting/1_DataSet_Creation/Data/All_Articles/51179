Apple may be ditching its proprietary lightning port infavour of a standard USB-C port for the iPhone 8.

A new report in the Wall Street Journal suggests that Apple is planning to include “a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company’s original Lightning connector.”

While the crux of the WSJ report focuses on Apple using a flexible OLED screen for it’s upcoming phone, the switch to USB-C may end up having a bigger impact on users.

The USB-C port — is currently standard on most new Android phones, like the Google Pixel, Xiaomi Mi5, LG G6, OnePlus 3 among others.

The USB-C port itself is not alien to Apple. All current-gen Apple Macbooks come with the with the reversible port as standard.

Accessory makers will be the worst affected as most iPhone add-ons are dependent on the Lightning port for connectivity. A change in the connector will either make these accessories unusable or will force users buy an adapter.

This will not be the first time Apple has changed a port on the iPhone. Five years ago Apple introduced the Lightning connector on the iPhone 5 which replaced the older 30-pin port. Last year Apple ditched the 3.5 mm earphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.
