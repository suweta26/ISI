The safety and security of Indians living abroad is a “top priority” for the government, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said on Wednesday, her first remarks in Parliament on the growing racist attacks on foreigners, particularly in the United States.

Swaraj told Parliament that the US authorities had given a “positive response” on India’s concerns over attacks on its citizens or people of Indian origin.

“These are stray incidents and they don’t reflect the sentiments of entire America towards Indians,” she said.

Replying on the issues related to the killing and atrocities on Indians in the US, Swaraj said, “Even if there is one Indian in trouble we try to solve (the problem) in 24 hours.”

She revealed that when Garmin employee Srinivas Kuchibhotla was shot dead by a former US soldier in Kansas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked her “every day what MEA (ministry of external affairs) is doing and what it plans to do in future.”
