Former Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and 23 other players of the Jharkhand state team were safely rescued after a hotel in West Delhi’s Dwarka, where they were staying, caught fire on Friday morning.

The cricketers were in Delhi to play for the Vijay Hazare Trophy. They were to play Bengal in the semi-final match on Friday which has now been postponed.

There were a total of 540 people inside the Welcome Hotel in Dwarka when the fire was reported around 6am. Many were trapped inside, but the fire fighters and police managed to rescue them.

The blaze started at a Reliance store located on the first floor of the hotel, said Surender Kumar, DCP (South-West). Dhoni was on the ninth floor while other cricketers were staying across three floors from seventh to ninth.

Though police said that the fire was brought under control by 8.30am, fire officers said the fire fighting operations are still on.

“We are still ascertaining whether everyone has been brought out safely. More than 30 fire tenders have been rushed there,” said Atul Garg, chief fire officer, Delhi Fire Services.

The fire quickly spread to the other floors, engulfing the building in thick smoke. “Guests were stuck on the seventh and eighth floors as well. We rescued them,” said Garg.

The extent of the damage and the cause of the blaze is yet to be ascertained.
