The home side made four changes to the side while the away side remained unchanged.

In the barren first half, the best chance fell to Shivajians as Biaklian Paite who wasted his chance after neat play from Juan Quero and Nirmal Chettri.

The second half was as sedate as the first with both teams failing to muster any opportunities of note.

The match came to life in the dying minutes when substitute H. Lalmuankima burst down the left flank skipping past Chettri and teeing up Laldanmawia who tapped in to send the away supporters into delirium.
