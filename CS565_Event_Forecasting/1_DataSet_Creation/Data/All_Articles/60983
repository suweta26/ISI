The state government had replaced the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) that was introduced in June 2013 with previously held Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) from the academic year 2017 for students in Gujarat through a notification issued last year.

JEE was made compulsory as a common entrance test in these courses since 2013 but within four years the government withdrew it and with the GR, the provision of JEE being mandatory was abolished and instead of it, GujCET is to be conducted.

Students will be admitted in engineering and pharmacy courses on merit list with 60 per cent weightage given to marks scored in four semesters and 40 per cent to GujCET percentile.
