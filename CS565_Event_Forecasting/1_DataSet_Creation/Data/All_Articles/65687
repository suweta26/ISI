14-3-2017 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the movement to make Uttar Pradesh the “best state” had begun in 2014 and it received a big boost on March 11, a reference to the BJP’s resounding poll victory.

In a series of tweets posted in response to comments made by some followers, he also said that everyone has to work together to take India to new heights.

“...I can say that development today has become a ‘Jan Andolan’ (mass movement),” Modi tweeted in response to a comment.

“When UP develops, India develops. Movement towards making Uttar Pradesh ‘Uttam Pradesh’ (best state) began in 2014 & received a big boost on 11th March,” Modi added in response to a comment by another follower on Twitter who was taking a dig at those questioning his track record as the Prime Minister.

He was clearly referring to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll results declared on March 11, in which the BJP got three-fourths majority in the 403-member Assembly.

“We are respected globally due to 125 crore Indians, who have shown their strengths & capabilities,” the Prime Minister said in response to another comment.

In reply to another comment, he said, “Absolutely. Happy to be the ‘Pradhan Sevak’ (prime servant) for each and every Indian.”
