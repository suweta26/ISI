Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin joint No. 1 in ICC Test rankings 
8-3-2017 
India’s spin twins Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin are on top of the world. According to the latest International Cricket Council rankings for Test bowlers, Jadeja has joined Ashwin as the world’s leading bowlers.

Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin finished with six-wicket hauls in the second India vs Australia Test in Bangalore. This was the first time in a Test match when four bowlers -- Australia’s Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood also returned six-wicket hauls -- finished with six-fors.

India won a dramatic Test match by 75 runs after Australia were set a winning target of 188 on a wearing Day 4 wicket at Bangalore’s Chinnaswamy Stadium.

In a Test match that was marred by DRS controversies and some pantomime, Jadeja and Ashwin stood out with their performances.

Ravindra Jadeja’s seven wickets in the match, which included a crucial six for 63 in the first innings, helped him move up one rank to reach the top position for the first time in his career. The last time two bowlers shared the top spot was in April 2008 when Dale Steyn and Muttiah Muralidaran were at the top.

Ravichandran Ashwin’s eight wickets took him past spin legend Bishan Bedi’s tally of 266 wickets and made him the fifth-highest wicket-taker for India in Tests with 269 wickets.

Australia spinner Nathan Lyon’s eight wickets in the match have lifted him two places to 16th rank while his team’s left-arm spinner Steve O’Keefe and India pace bowler Umesh Yadav have gained one place each to reach career-best 28th and 29th places, respectively.
