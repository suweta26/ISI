Remnants of pre-Harappan civilisation, which are presumed to be of more than 6,000-year-old, were found in the district during excavations works to revive the Saraswati river. “Remnants found during excavations along the river course may be the oldest as the Harappan civilisation is around 3,500-year-old and the pre-Harappan civilisation is around 5,000 to 6,000-year-old,” Deputy Commissioner of Fatehabad N K Solanki said on Saturday.
