Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is powered by a Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor with Adreno 506 GPU. It gets a 13MP rear camera with PDAF, f/2.0 aperture and 5MP camera on the front. The Redmi Note 4 runs MIUI 8 beta based on Android Marshmallow. This is a dual-SIM smartphone but with a hybrid SIM slot. The phone supports 4G VoLTE in India.

In our review, we like the phone’s battery life, and the overall performance. The UI is boosted with some nifty features like dual apps, which will let users run two WhatsApp accounts. However, the camera’s low light performance is still an issue.
