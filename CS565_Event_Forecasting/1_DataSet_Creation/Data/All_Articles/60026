Barcelona’s amazing 6-1 victory over Paris St Germain that sent them through to the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday was not the Harlem Globetrotters, according to coach Luis Enrique. The Spanish side, who lost the first leg 4-0, struck three late goals in six minutes to complete an extraordinary comeback after losing the first leg 4-0.

“I was brought to my knees. I would like to thank everyone who kept their faith after we lost 4-0. This is dedicated to them because this isn’t the Harlem Globetrotters, this is football,” Luis Enrique told reporters. “I don’t think anyone stopped believing. After seeing them sitback despite the goal, the team were incredible,” he added. “We risked everything and it paid off. You get finales like this very occasionally in football and this time it was our turn,” added Luis Enrique who is leaving the club at the end of the season.

“A feat like this does everyone good and I’m delighted to enjoy a moment like this. The key was our efficiency. The sixth goal was scored with the hope of the fan who was on the other side of the world,” Luis Enrique said.
