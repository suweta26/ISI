There are over 10,000 Home Guards and around 12,000 Civil Defence Volunteers in the national capital.

The Directorate General of Home Guards has issued a circular asking interested candidates to apply for the training programme for pipe band.

“A volunteer who is selected for band training and completes the training programme can apply for band test to be conducted by Army, Air Force, Navy, Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Delhi Police, Delhi Fire Service, etc.,” the circular stated.

Civil Defence Volunteers and Home Guards had played an important role in the implementation of the car rationing scheme odd-even which was aimed at reducing pollution level in Delhi last year.

They had been deployed by the Delhi government across the city and they had also been given the task of persuading motorists to follow odd-even rules.
