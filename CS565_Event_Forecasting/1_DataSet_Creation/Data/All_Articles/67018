15-3-2017 
German police on Wednesday found an “explosive” package at finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble’s office building, a day before he is due to host his new US counterpart Steven Mnuchin for talks.

“The package contained an explosive mix,” Berlin police said in a statement, adding that the substance is often used in the production of fireworks.

“It was designed to cause severe injuries when the package is opened,” said police.

The parcel was intercepted in the ministry mailroom.

Investigations were ongoing into the case, they added.
