Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu lawmaker in the US Congress, has been elected as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans.

The level of engagement seen in both the House and Senate on issues related to India and America’s partnership and friendship “only continues to grow,” Gabbard said, after she was formally announced as the co-chair. The three-term Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, who has made a mark for herself on key foreign policy and national security issues, is the first ever woman to be elected as co-chair of the House Congressional Caucus on India.

She succeeds her Democratic congressional colleague Indian-American Dr Ami Bera. Her Republican co-chair is congressman George Holding from North Carolina.

“Congressman Holding and I are working together on what is the legislative strategy for building an agenda for the caucus to move forward in the 115th Congress,” Gabbard told a selected gathering of influential Indian-Americans and key lawmakers at a round table at the US Capitol, organised jointly by US-India Friendship Council and US India Business Council.

Noting that there is growing momentum, interest and excitement around the India-US relationship, Gabbard said there is unity on issues of cooperation and opportunity between the two countries. “We have to capture this moment and really take advantage of the continued interest, not taking this for granted and be vigil and in doing so,” she said.

“We are off to a great start in the current administration. Some of the brightest time for the US-India relationship is for now and in the future,” Holding said.

“Good times are ahead as far as military to military cooperation is concerned,” he said, adding that the lawmakers are talking about how to merge and compliment the Make in India and America First doctrine.
