A woman and her father-in-law, who ran to her rescue, were killed by a tiger in a forest close to the Corbett national park on Thursday morning, officials said.

The bodies were recovered from deep inside the forest in the afternoon after a forest team tranquilised the big cat.

A resident of Ramnagar, 30-year-old Bagwati had gone to forest near Choi to pick firewood. A tiger pounced on her and dragged her inside the jungle, sources said.

Hearing her scream, Bagwati’s father-in-law Lakhpat, whose shanty is close to the forest, rushed to save her but was also attacked by the tiger, sources said.

By noon, locals and a team of forest officials reached the river bank where the two bodies were lying but couldn’t recover them as the animal was pacing close by, sources said.

The animal even charged at the crowd.

Divisional forest officer Kahkashan Naseem confirmed the bodies were recovered after the tiger was tranquilised. The seven-year-old tiger was caged and would be moved to a zoo in Nanital, she said.

Bagwati and Lakhpat were from Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh and came to Ramnagar two months ago to work at a quarry on Dabka river bank.

Dense forests and tigers in Corbett attract thousands of tourists every year but the area is also seeing a growing man-animal conflict.

While number of tigers in one of India’s oldest reserves has increased so has the human population in the neighbouring villages.

Home to around 200 tigers, Corbett has the highest density of big cats in the country.

Villagers often enter the reserve for firewood and fodder and fall prey to the tiger. In October, a man-eater was killed near Ramnagar after a massive 40-day search.
