NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday said the price control of stents would result in annual savings of about Rs 4,450 crore for patients in the country."Reduction of prices of stents by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) on February 12, 2017 will result in approximate annual savings of about Rs 4,450 crore to patients," minister of state for chemicals Mansukh L Mandaviya said in the Lok Sabha.He said, "Price regulation has brought down the prices of bare metal stent by 74% and that of drug-eluting stents by 85%".The NPPA had notified the ceiling price of coronary stents at Rs 7,260 for bare metal stent and Rs 29,600 for drug-eluting ones. The corresponding average MRPs before the notification stood at Rs45,100 and Rs 1.21 lakh.The minister said the NPPA has directed hospitals across the country to issue detailed bills to patients, specifically and separately mentioning cost of the coronary stents along with brand name of manufacturer or importer and other details.He said, "Non-adherence to the rules will be treated as deliberate distortion of evidence along with charges of overpricing, inviting prosecution under the Essential Commodities Act".Besides, the government through the NPPA is keeping a tab and has alerted the states and state drug controllers to monitor the availability of stents, he said. "Industry has been apprised that all manufacturers and importers are under legal obligation to maintain smooth production and supply of coronary stents of all brands which were available in the country before price cap," the minister said.
