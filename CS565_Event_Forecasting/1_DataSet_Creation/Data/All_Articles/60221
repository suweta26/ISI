‘Missing you a lot’: Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s sends him Facebook wish on his birthday 
9-3-2017 
Aviation engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla would have celebrated his 33rd birthday on Thursday, had he not fallen victim to the bullets of an American man at a bar in Kansas last month.

His wife Sunayana Dumala remembered her husband by sharing a note on Facebook early in the morning, receiving hundreds of responses.

“Happy Birthday My Love!! It feels weird to wish you this way. Missing you a lot. Hoping you are celebrating and having fun in your new abode surrounded by wonderful things and people, with only love around. Lots of love...” Sunayana posted on her wall.

His parents – K Madhusudhana Chary and Parvatha Vardhini – are yet to get out of the shock, let alone remembering the birthday of their son. His cousin Krishna Mohan said the family members were yet to come out of mourning and did not want to get disturbed.

On the day of his funeral, his family members remembered how they used to celebrate his birthday every year. They recalled that Kuchibhotla used to make a video call over Skype on his birthday and talk to everybody in the family. “He used to take blessings of his parents on the video call only,” his elder brother K T Sastry had told the media.

Telangana NRI Parents’ Association and All India Peace and Solidarity Organisation have planned a candle light rally at Kasu Brahmananda Reddy Park in Banjara Hills in Hyderabad on Thursday evening to pay tributes to Kuchibhotla. They gave a call on social media: “Wake up India and unite to save NRIs in the US” and asked the people to raise their voice against the attacks on Indians in the US.
