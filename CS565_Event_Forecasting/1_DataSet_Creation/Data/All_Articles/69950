Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp remains convinced he is the best person to lead the club to its first Premier League title since 1990. With just three wins from last nine Premier League games, Liverpool have seen their title bid fade but back-to-back victories over Arsenal and Burnley have helped strengthen their grip on a top-four spot.

Liverpool’s slump since the turn of the year may have dashed hopes of silverware but Klopp felt qualification for next season’s Champions League would represent “an outstanding success”.

“I feel supporters still think I’m the right person in the right place so we feel that trust and faith,” Klopp told British media. “I always think about alternatives. Is there somebody else who could do it better?

“If I knew somebody who could do it better I wouldn’t be here. How long it will take? I have no idea but everybody should see we tried every day really hard.

“I would say this season going to the Champions League would be an outstanding success because of all the quality around us.”

Klopp also called for patience in his quest to end the club’s wait for the league title.

“There is pressure and sometimes we are still not patient enough,” he added ahead of Sunday’s trip to Manchester City.

“We have a lot of fans that maybe were not alive when we won the last title. My job is to make it more likely.”

Liverpool are fourth in the table with 55 points, one behind third-placed City, who have a game in hand.
