Citing the military’s media wing, Dawn said three of the terrorists have been identified, while the remaining two are “probably Afghans”. At least one of the identified militants was a member of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.

“Sacrifice of our soldiers will not go waste. Terrorist will be brought to their end and held accountable for their Fasaad (violence),” Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed his deepest condolences over the killing of two soldiers while fighting terrorists in Swabi district.

“Our Armed Forces are fighting the menace of terrorism to protect our democratic values, constitution, freedom, and our way of life. We cannot and will not allow our enemies to promote their nefarious designs. Operation Radd-ul-Fassad will continue until our homeland is cleared from the scourge of terrorism,” Sharif said.

Six soldiers were killed yesterday in attacks by militants near Afghan border.

Army said that in punitive response at least 15 attackers from Afghanistan were killed.

Pakistan last month launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad to clean the country of remnants of militants after dismantling their hideouts in remote tribal region.
