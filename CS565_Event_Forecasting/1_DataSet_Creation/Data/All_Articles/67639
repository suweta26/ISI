Honda WR-V launched at Rs 7.75L: 5 things to know about the ‘Jazz on steroids’ 
16-3-2017 
Honda launched its new Jazz-based cross-hatchback WR-V at Rs 7.75 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) on Thursday.

The diesel variant starts at Rs 8.70 lakh.

Honda launched two variants, each, in petrol and diesel. The higher version of the petrol VX model is priced at Rs 8.99 lakh, and that of the diesel variant is priced at Rs 9.99 lakh.

The “Winsome Runabout vehicle”, abbreviated as WR-V will have a formidable competition from Toyota’s Etios Cross, Volkswagen’s Polo Cross and Hyundai’s i20 Active.

Apart from the tail-gate, the WR-V looks more of a Jazz on steroids.

Here are five other things to know:

1) WR-V is derived from Jazz from core to the skin. The bodyline, styling on the inside and the mechanicals under the hood are all taken from the hot hatch and beefed up to make a WR-V.

Honda is placing this car between Jazz and the BR-V in its portfolio, so this one is expected to hold price tags between Rs 7 to 10 lakh.

2) Honda has made this car distinct from Jazz in its styling and feel: The bonnet line is raised, the Honda logo sits on the thick chrome slat floating over a honeycomb grille and the bumper is sculpted to emote aggression of a cross.

The rear is partly inspired from Jazz but more from the BR-V. The L-shaped tail lamps are placed on a tapering V-tailgate. The contrasting silver skidplates on the blackened bumper add to the cross-hatch feel which we also see in the other cars in the segment.

3) Honda has worked smart to make the cabin space contemporary. The gadgetry comes from the new City – the floating DigiPad is a seven-inch touchscreen that can be connected to Wi-Fi for MirrorLink smartphone connectivity and navigation, and comes loaded with 1.5GB on-board storage. There are two USB slots, two micro-SD card slots and an HDMI port too. And then there’s a reversing camera with multi-views.

The best view from inside a WR-V however could come from the first-in-class sunroof.

4) Honda WR-V borrows its engines from the Jazz.

i-VTEC 1.2litre petrol | 90 hp (91.2 PS) power @ 6000 rpm | 110 Nm torque @ 4800 rpm | 5-speed manual gearbox

i-DTEC 1.5litre diesel | 100 hp (101.3 PS) power @ 3600 rpm | 200 Nm @ 1750 rpm | 6-speed manual gearbox

5) The new WR-V has been pit against the i20 Active which starts at Rs 6.77 lakh, Toyota Etios Cross starting Rs 6.6 lakh and the Volkswagen Cross Polo which comes north of Rs 7.76 lakh.
