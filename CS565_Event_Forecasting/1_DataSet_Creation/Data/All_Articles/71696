Shave your head, pierce ears to look like Yogi, Lalu tells Sushil Modi 
20-3-2017 
PATNA: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad has asked senior Bihar Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Kumar Modi to wear a saffron robe, pierce his ears and shave his head to look like Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath so that he could derive some benefits from the party.

Prasad also mocked Modi for not being invited to the swearing-in ceremony of the new Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister.

It is another matter that Modi attended the swearing-in ceremony in Lucknow, along with a large number other senior BJP leaders and Union ministers.

Prasad’s witty tweet was in reply to Modi’s comment on the microblogging site, taking a potshot on the RJD leader for his anti-BJP utterances during the recent UP assembly polls.

Prasad had campaigned for the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was disseminated in the UP elections.

On Sunday, Modi had tweeted: “Yogi ke CM banne se (Lalu) itne sadme mein hain ki kya gaali de samaj nahin aa raha hai (Lalu is in such a shock after Yogi’s elevation as CM that he is unable to find new invectives to denounce him)”.
