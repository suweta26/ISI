Sensex, Nifty may open lower tracking Asian markets, Fed rate jitters 
15-3-2017 
Indian shares may open flat or lower tracking Asian cues and firm dollar ahead of the US Federal Reserve monetary policy review which is widely perceived to raise policy interest rates by 25 bps.

On Tuesday, the Nifty closed at all time high of 9,087 and Sensex surged 1.7% on Tuesday as investors saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh as an endorsement of his economic reform agenda.

The broader NSE Nifty rose as much as 2.1 percent to the record high in the first trading session since the election results were announced, surpassing its previous peak of 9,119.20 hit on March 4, 2015.

The Sensex too soared to reach 29,561.93 in early morning trade as the Bombay Stock Exchange opened after a three-day holiday and for the first time since results of the five-state assembly polls were announced on Saturday. But it closed up 496 points or 1.7% at 29,442.63.

After Wall Street closed in the red, Asian markets traded cautiously. The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1% in early trade.

Nikkei was down 0.3% while Hang Seng and Strait Times fell 0.4% each and Kospi 0.2%.

In the next three days, investors will be on edges ahead of policy reviews by the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. Europe is also embroiled in political uncertainties ahead of a Dutch election and the impending Brexit.
