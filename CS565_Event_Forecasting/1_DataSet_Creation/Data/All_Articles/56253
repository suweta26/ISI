This could turn out to be the most exciting role for actor Neil Nitin Mukesh’s Bollywood career so far. There has been speculation for the past few weeks that Neil would play the role of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s younger son, the late Sanjay Gandhi, in National Award-winning filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar’s next film, Indu Sarkar.

With this exclusive photo, HT City not only confirms the news, but shows the actor’s look in the film. “Neil has been doing a lot of reading for the film to ensure he is able to deliver what the film of this magnitude demands. Getting his on-screen look took close to six months to perfect, with prosthetic make-up experts flown in from abroad,” says a source.

In a recreation of the iconic photo showing Indira Gandhi with Sanjay, Neil seems to have nailed the look.
