Neymar was the hero of hte match as he scored two goals in the 88th and 90th minute to help Barcelona equalise on aggregate but PSG were ahead with the away goal advantage, a goal scored by Edinson Cavani.

“This is the best match of my career,” Neymar later said. But there were many other who hailed this match as the best ever.
