All India Congress Committee general secretary Digvijaya Singh said his proposal for a pre-poll alliance with the Goa Forward was “sabotaged” by his own party leaders.

“As a strategy, I had proposed a secular alliance with the regional party headed by Babush Monserratte and Goa Forward headed by Vijai Sardesai… Our alliance with Babush went through and we won 3 out of 5, but our alliance with Goa Forward was sabotaged by our own leaders. Sad,” he said in a series of tweets.
