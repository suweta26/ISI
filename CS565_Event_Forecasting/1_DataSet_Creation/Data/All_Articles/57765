Named after the Chinese name for the Big Dipper constellation, the BeiDou system is designed to offer an alternative to Americaâ€™s Global positioning System. A government white paper published in December said China expects to provide basic services to limited number of clients in 2018 and expand to all clients with more accurate and reliable services through better ground and satellite-based systems by 2020.
