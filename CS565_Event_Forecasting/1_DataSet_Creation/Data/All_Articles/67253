15-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: Expressing dismay over the state of affairs in the CBI, a parliamentary panel has slammed the anti-corruption agency for not utilising funds given to it, sometimes up to 50% in schemes related to modernisation or forensics . The panel also slammed the ministry of personnel and the CBI over shortage of staff.Interestingly, the agency, which is handling probes like 2G scam, coal scam, AgustaWestland scam, Saradha, Vyapam and others involving politicians and bureaucrats, has claimed that "investigators do not want to join it on deputation due to lack of housing in the agency".The parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances and law and justice, in its 19th report, tabled in Rajya Sabha , warned the CBI that if fund utilisation kept such a low pace, it may face reduction of funds at revised estimates stage.On vacancies in CBI, it said there was shortage of 1,594 officers, which was 21.84% short of the sanctioned strength (7,274).
