“Those killed were part of Taliban and were planning to carry out attacks in the district,” a security official said.

Another official said the dead bodies of the militants were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Swabi for identification.

Pakistan launched operation ‘Radd-ul-Fasaad’ — an Arabic word which translates roughly to ‘elimination of discord’ –last month after militants killed more than 125 people in a fresh wave of attacks.

The operations are being carried out on the basis of intelligence and target not only the militants but also their handlers, financiers and supporters.
