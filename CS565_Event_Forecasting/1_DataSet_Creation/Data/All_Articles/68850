Shashi Tharoor reacts to petition propping him as UPA’s 2019 PM candidate 
17-3-2017 
Shashi Tharoor has finally broken his silence over a viral petition calling on the UPA to name him as their prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 general elections.

The petition, which was started by a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor’s Lok Sabha seat, has already garnered more than 16,000 signatures. The online petition has come at a time when the Congress, following a humiliating defeat in the recently held assembly elections, is looking for a face in the grand alliance of opposition parties to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

On Friday, Tharoor posted his response to the petition on his Facebook account, saying while he was ‘touched’ by the gesture, he would request the creator to withdraw it.

“I am a member of Parliament for the Congress Party, nothing more and nothing less. The party has a settled leadership, which is not up for debate. When changes occur they do so through an established procedure,” Tharoor writes in the post.

The senior Congress leader has made headlines with his latest book, An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India. His speeches and television appearances where he discusses Britain’s“historical amnesia” over the excesses of the empire have been widely shared on social media.

In response to Tharoor’s post, Vikrant Gupta, a commentator said, “I believe its time for the leadership of your party to recognise the greater role you can play in Indian politics. The ruling party recognises your potential but alas your own party does not.”
