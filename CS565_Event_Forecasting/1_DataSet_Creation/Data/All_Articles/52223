RGV was speaking at the trailer launch of Sarkar 3 - the third instalment of his Sarkar franchise.

Talking about the film which has Amitabh Bachchan reprising the role of powerful leader Subhash Nagre, who is addressed as Sarkar in the film, the filmmaker said, “A person takes up the law because he believes that he is doing it for the oppressed people though it is illegal in the eyes of the system. But in the eyes of the audience, it is the righteous thing because they connect with the emotion that’s why Sarkar becomes more powerful as a leader.”

“Sarkar 3 is full of grey characters. There is no such hero or heroine or a villain as such. All of them strongly believe in their own convictions,” he added.

The film also stars Manoj Bajpayee, Amit Sadh, Jackie Shroff and Yami Gautam.

Sarkar 3 is set to release on April 7.
