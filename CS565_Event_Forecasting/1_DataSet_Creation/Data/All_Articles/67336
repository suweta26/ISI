MUMBAI: In a first, six Chinese nationals , including a pregnant woman who was later identified as the ringleader, were arrested by the customs officials at the international airport for trying to smuggle into the country 6.1kg gold worth Rs 1.85 crore on Wednesday . They were later released on bail.The main accused in the case is 32-year-old Zhou Liwui , a businesswoman and a frequent visitor to India. Liwui, who is into import and export of diamonds, would come to Mumbai to meet her clients at the Bharat Diamond Bourse in Bandra-Kurla Complex, said officials. She is believed to have convinced the others to indulge in gold smuggling to make easy money .Officials said one of the reasons for channelizing the smuggling through China could be that the "suspicion quotient" is minimal.
