6-3-2017 
At least seven teenage girls of an orphanage in North Kerala’s Wayanad district were being raped by five persons for the past two months, police said after arresting all the accused on Monday.

The incident came to the light in the district’s Kalpetta town after a local alerted police after seeing a girl coming out of a shop in tears. The five-member gang used to lure the children to the shop and sexually assaulted them there.

The victims later told police they were facing the ordeal for the past two months.

All the victims are in the age group of 14-16, a senior police officer of the district said, adding all the accused are now in police custody.

“It is a shocking incident. Police investigation is moving in the right direction,” said Kalpetta MLA C K Saseendran.

Kalpetta incident comes close on the heels of the arrest of a priest in the district last Monday for raping a minor girl. The girl gave birth to a baby girl last month.

The main accused Father Robin Vadakkumcherry, vicar of St Sebastian church in Kottiyoor, was arrested while he was trying to flee the country. Seven others, including five nuns and two doctors, were also made accused in the case.
