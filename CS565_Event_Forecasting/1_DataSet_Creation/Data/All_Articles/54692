Even as Pawan Kalyan awaits the release of his new film Katamarayudu later this month, we have learnt that he is all set to commence the shooting for his next project with filmmaker Trivikram from April.

The yet-to-be-titled project marks the star’s third collaboration with the director after the highly successful previous outings Jalsa and Attarintiki Daaredhi. The first schedule, which will last for a month, will be shot in Dubai, and the makers have already started making arrangements for the trip.

Tipped to be another entertainer, the film will feature Keerthy Suresh and Anu Emmanuel as the leading ladies. Having been cast opposite Pawan Kalyan, these young actresses have literally struck jackpot and must be really excited. Popular actress-politician Khushbhu Sundar has landed a pivotal role and she is also expected to join the sets from the second week of April.

Meanwhile, Pawan will start promoting Katamarayudu, the Telugu remake of Tamil blockbuster Veeram, in full swing from next week. Set against a faction backdrop, the film also stars Shruti Haasan and Tarun Arora among others. The first single – Mira Mira Meesam - from the album released on Friday has already clocked over a million in just four hours.
