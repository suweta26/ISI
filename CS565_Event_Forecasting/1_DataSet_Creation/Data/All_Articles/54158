Election Commission rejects AIADMK reply on Sasikala’s elevation 
3-3-2017 
The Election Commission rejected on Friday the response of Tamil Nadu’s ruling AIADMK party on the elevation of VK Sasikala as its general secretary, saying TTV Dinakaran, who signed the letter, was not in its list of the party’s office-bearers.

It has now asked Sasikala to either sign the response herself or by an authorised signatory who is in the commission’s list of AIADMK office bearers and send it again by March 10.

“... Dinakaran (Sasikala’s nephew, who was hurriedly reinducted into the party and nominated AIADMK deputy general secretary) is not an office bearer of your party as per the Commission’s record... The reply should either be submitted under your own signature or you may duly authorise somebody to do so on your behalf,” the poll watchdog said.

Sasikala is at present lodged in a Bengaluru jail.

The AIADMK had defended the decision to appoint Sasikala as its interim general secretary, saying the general council of the party has the authority to make such an appointment.

In its response to the February 17 notice by the Election Commission, the AIADMK also said those who later complained against Sasikala’s elevation had initially signed the resolution in her support.

The party had told the Commission that its functioning would have come to a standstill had a new general secretary not been appointed after the demise of J Jayalalithaa.
