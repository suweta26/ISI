13-3-2017 
Following ceasefire violations by Pakistan troops, Union minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said the people should trust the Modi government that it will give a “befitting” response to such acts.

“The concerned agencies will take into cognisance the chain of events that has taken place and you should trust the Modi government to give a befitting response,” Singh told reporters here replying to questions about ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces.

In a second instance of ceasefire violation in less than 24 hours, Pakistani troops on Monday had resorted to mortar shelling and firing by automatic weapons along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, which prompted the army to retaliate.

“Indian government and security agencies are capable of meeting any kind of challenge and you will see the results in days to come,” Singh, the Minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), said.

The minister chose not answer questions on handing over of two boys from PoK to Pakistani authorities after the NIA dropped charges of conspiracy in the Uri terror strike.

“I am not able to reply to such sensitive issues which has security ramifications and concerned agencies have to deal with this,” Singh said.

Under detention for nearly six months, the two boys were handed over to Pakistani authorities after the probe agency NIA came to a conclusion that they had strayed into the Indian side after a tiff with their parents due to pressure of studies.
