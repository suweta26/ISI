The doctors are from the department of emergency and anaesthesia.

As the plane caught fire after the impact on Sunday, the two doctors from Gurgaon’s Medanta Hospital sustained burn injuries.

“Yes, they have had burn injuries in the accident, but fortunately the injuries are not life-threatening,” said a hospital source, requesting anonymity.

A separate team of doctors from Medanta left for Thailand later that day to ensure proper treatment for the injured doctors at a burns facility. “They will help in transferring the injured from local hospital to a proper health facility,” said the source.

The hospital had hired a charter plane that flew from New Delhi at 8.42am on Sunday to pick up a patient from Bangkok, who reportedly was suffering from a lung disease.

The aircraft also had two pilots. The plane took a refuelling stop in Kolkata en route to Bangkok. It reportedly crash-landed at Nakhon Pathom airport about 730km from Bangkok on Sunday afternoon.
