Congress had demanded that the Naliya gangrape case, in which some BJP office-bearers were arrested, be probed by a sitting judge of HC. Congress MLAs had created ruckus in the House over the issue during the initial days of the ongoing budget session. CM Rupani had assured them of a judicial probe into the episode from the floor of the House. However, till date, there was no announcement of a judicial commission in that regard. The issue was raised in the Assembly again on Tuesday by the leader of the Opposition Shankersinh Vaghela. He asked that if necessary, they could approach the Chief Justice of the HC.

Jadeja replied that he would speak with the CM in that regard and then appropriate announcement will be made. Accordingly, Jadeja announced Rupani’s decision to appoint a commission headed by a retired judge of HC to probe the incident.
