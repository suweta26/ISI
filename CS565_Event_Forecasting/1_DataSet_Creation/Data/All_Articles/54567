88-yr-old woman stops rape by lying to be HIV-positive in US 
4-3-2017 
An 88-year-old Pennsylvania woman stopped an attacker from raping her by lying to him that she was HIV-positive.

“I have HIV and my husband died of it,” the woman said to the intruder who had entered her apartment, Philly.com reported.

She told WPVI-TV the man forced his way into her Parkesburg apartment on the afternoon of Feb 17. He rifled through her purse, took $40 and was preparing to sexually assault her.

The elderly woman said she also “kicked him where it hurt him the most” before he fled.

No arrests have been made.

The robbery is unrelated to another attack in Chester County last month.

In that case, a 72-year-old woman was bound and locked inside a closet, where she wasn’t discovered for four days.

A 17-year-old boy is charged.
