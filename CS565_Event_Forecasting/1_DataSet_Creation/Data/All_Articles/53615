3-3-2017 
The Kerala government ordered a probe after the Congress-led opposition legislators read out details of the state budget even as finance minister Thomass Issac was presenting the document in the House.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called it an “unprecedented situation” and Speaker Sreerama Krishanan said if the budget was leaked out it was a serious issue.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said Issac should resign because the budget was leaked from his office and its details were on social media before his speech.

“The sanctity of the budget has been compromised. It has never happened in the legislative history of the country The finance minister has no moral responsibility to continue in office,” said Congress spokesman Rajmohan Unnithan.
