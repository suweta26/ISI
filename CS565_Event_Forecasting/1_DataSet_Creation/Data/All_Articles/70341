Appointment of Yogi Adityanath as the next Uttar Pradesh chief minister on Saturday evening evoked sharp reactions from opposition parties.

The BJP’s arch rival, the Congress, however, was relatively guarded in its reaction on the elevation of Gorakhpur MP to the top post.

Party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said it was the prerogative of the ruling party to choose a chief ministerial candidate.

The delay in naming the chief minister and appointment of two deputy chief ministers reflected a bitter power struggle within the BJP, Surjewala added.

Wishing the new government well, he hoped that it will now rise above internal power conflicts and concentrate on fulfilling its poll promises such as waiving of farmers loans, reducing electricity tariff, giving more than 50% MSP (minimum support price) to farmers, creating jobs for youth, reviving industries and undertaking ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’.

Surjewala said the Congress will continue to act as watchdog and play a constructive role in the progress of UP.

Other opposition parties, however, did not mince words to flay the move.

The CPI (M) accused the BJP of systematically playing communal card in India’s biggest state, soon after the BJP named the firebrand MP as its legislature party leader in UP.

The party’s politburo member Md. Salim said, “Selection of Adityanath is the culmination of Modi-Amit Shah brand of politics in the state where the BJP systematically played communal card.”

The Biju Janata Dal, which often supported the BJP in the parliament, too questioned the decision saying Adityanath had no administrative experience to handle the post.

“He (Yogi Adityanath) never held any administrative post. This is an opportunity for him to prove his mettle. I hope he lives up to the expectations of all the people in UP,” said BJD leader Bhartrahari Mahtab.
