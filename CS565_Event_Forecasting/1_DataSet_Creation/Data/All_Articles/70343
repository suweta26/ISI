18-3-2017 
The BJP ended a week of suspense on Saturday by naming Gorakhpur MP, Yogi Adityanath, as the chief minister designate for Uttar Pradesh. Adityanath‚Äôs name evoked sharp reactions from the opposition, but inspired a flurry of memes on Twitter.

Many spotted an ‚Äúuncanny resemblance‚Äù between the saffron-clad yogi and Hollywood‚Äôs action star Vin Diesel. From photo combinations of the two to photoshopped images of Adityanath‚Äôs face on Diesel‚Äôs body, Twitter trolls kept the memes coming.
