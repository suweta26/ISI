The body of a nine-year-old tribal girl, a student of a state-run primary Ashram school in Odisha’s Kandhamal district, was found hanging in a hostel room, police said on Friday.

The victim was a student of Class 3 of the school at Belpadar, run by the Tribal and Rural Development department. She was identified as Tulasha Kanhar, who had appeared for her drawing examination on Friday morning.

The girl allegedly hanged herself using a bedsheet, said Ganeswar Bharimala, the district welfare officer of Kandhamal.

The girl was taken to the district headquarters hospital at Phulbani where doctors decalred her brought dead.

Sarojini Swain, her class teacher, said, “There was no apparent reason on her part to take such an extreme step. We are surprised.”

The girl’s father lodged an FIR with the Phulbani Sadar police station alleging murder of his daughter and demanded an impartial investigation.
