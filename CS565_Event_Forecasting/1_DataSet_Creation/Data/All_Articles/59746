“BSF troops on duty in the area of responsibility of the New Gazniwala border outpost in Abohar sector saw freshly dug soil ahead of the border security fence. Accordingly, a special search operation was launched.

“The BSF party seized nine packets (about 4.6 kgs) of a contraband, suspected to be heroin, concealed in the agricultural fields ahead of the border security fence,” said a BSF official.

With this, the BSF has seized a total of 36.401 kgs of heroin in Punjab so far in 2017.

The official said an enhanced vigil helped the BSF thwart an attempt to smuggle the contraband into India.
