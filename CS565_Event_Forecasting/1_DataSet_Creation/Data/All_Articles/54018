3-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: As medical aspiring students are allowed to opt either of eight regional languages or Hindi or English as a medium to take centralised medical entrance examination NEET, the Supreme Court on Friday sought explanation from Centre and Medical Council of India(MCI) on why Urdu language was left out.A bench of Kurian Joseph and R Banumathi issued notice to Centre and MCI seeking their response on why National Eligibility cum Entrance test be not also conducted in Urdu language which is sixth most spoken language in the country.The court passed the order on a petition filed by Student Islamic Organisation seeking its direction to the government to prepare question papers also in Urdu language to pave the way for Urdu-speaking students to take the test in their language. Some medical aspiring students have filed petitions on the issue.Advocate Ravindra S Garia , appearing for Delhi-based students organisation, contended that the government had decided to allow students to take exam in one of the ten languages--Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, Odya, Bengali, Tamil, Telgu, Kannada--but Urdu language was not allowed in NEET."The seventh most spoken language Gujarati, eighth most spoken language Kannada, tenth most spoken language Oriya and twelfth most spoken language Assamese have been given as options of medium for appearing in the exam but Urdu which is at the sixth rank has been arbitrarily excluded despite several state governments making specific requests to the Centre to include Urdu as a medium for NEET," he contended.He told the bench that a large number of students study science in Urdu medium in states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh , Telangana and they would suffer if they would not be allowed to take test in Urdu language."Urdu has also been accorded official language status in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand Uttarakhand , Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi. Thus there are a large number of students in each of these states who undertake secondary and higher secondary education, including in the science stream, in Urdu," he said.The bench, after a brief hearing, agreed to examine the issue and granted one week time to Centre and MCI to respond on why students should not be allowed to write entrance exam in Urdu language.
