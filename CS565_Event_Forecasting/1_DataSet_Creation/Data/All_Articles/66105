After his live Skype interview with BBC on the impeachment of South Korea’s president was gatecrashed by his children in the cutest manner possible, American academic Robert Kelly, whose family has now become an internet sensation, said that his error has turned his family into “YouTube stars”.

Kelly was discussing the impeachment of South Korea’s president on BBC World News, when his two children barged into his study in their apartment in Busan.

“Everybody we know seems to think it’s pretty hysterical. We understand why people find it enjoyable ... It’s funny,” Kelly told James Menendez, the BBC presenter who conducted the original interview, reports the Guardian.

“We were worried actually that the BBC would never call us again. That was our first response - mortification that we had completely blown our relationship with you,” Kelly added.

Many people have been smitten by the amusingly brash manner by Marion, four, as she entered the room and marched up to her father’s desk.

Kelly said that his daughter was “in a hippity-hoppity mood” because of a school party she had earlier in the day.

He said: “As soon as she opened the door I saw her image on my screen.”

However, Kelly valiantly attempted to guide Marion towards some toys, while hoping the broadcaster might narrow the camera angle or use some video of Park Geun-hye.

However, the channel did not cut away and as Kelly responded to a question about inter-Korean relations, his eight-month-old son, James, sauntered through the open door in his baby walker on the polished wooden floor.

The overwhelming response to the video, which soon went viral around the world, prompted the couple to turn off their smartphones and ignore social media for several days, unable to deal with the deluge of comments and requests to talk.

However, they broke their silence on Tuesday by giving interviews about the infamous interview.
