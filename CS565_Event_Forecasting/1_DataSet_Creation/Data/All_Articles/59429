A traitor can’t be my son, won’t take his body: Father of Lucknow terror suspect 
8-3-2017 
The father of Saifullah, who was killed in an anti-terror operation in Lucknow early on Wednesday, has refused to take the body of a “traitor”.

Sartaj told reporters that his son had left home around two and a half months back after being scolded for not working. He said he had hit his son a day before he left home. Saifullah had contacted his family on Monday last week and told them he was going to Saudi Arabia for a job.

“What he has done is not in national interest. We will not the take the dead body of such traitor,” Sartaj told reporters.

“A traitor cannot be my son. We are Indians, we were born in India, our forefathers have been born in India. One who works against this country is not my son,” he said.

“I used to tell him to find some employment, but he would not listen to me. I used to be angry with him, scolded him many times,” he said.

“Around two and a half months back, I slapped him for this. Next day I went to work, when I came back I got to know he has left,” he said.

Asked if Saifullah had contacted his family after leaving home, Sartaj said: “He called on last Monday, and said he has got visa to go to Saudi. I said it is your wish,” he added.

Saifullah was killed in an anti-terror operation in Lucknow early on Wednesday.

Superintendent of Police (Kanpur City) Somen Verma said Saifullah’s family was contacted but they refused to take the body.

He added that the police may again make an attempt to convince the family about it.

Meanwhile, the father of two other men, who have been arrested on terror-related charges, has claimed that they were innocent and has sought a fair probe.
