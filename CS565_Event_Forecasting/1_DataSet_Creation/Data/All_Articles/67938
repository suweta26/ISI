Is this why I transferred you?: Azam Khan yells at officer over muddy road 
16-3-2017 
Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan allegedly lashed out at Uttar Pradesh government officer on whose order his car was stopped from entering Rampur Mandi, forcing him to walk on a muddy stretch to collect his election victory certificate.

Rampur district administration officials said that the incident took place on March 11, the day of counting of votes when Khan, who won from the Rampur seat, went to collect his certificate from the returning officer.

Khan was not immediately available for comment.

The SP leader had allegedly fumed publicly at Abhay Kumar, the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Rampur Sadar, for asking his staff to stop his car. The outburst was captured on a mobile phone camera and soon went viral.

Khan told Kumar that he should not forget he was still the “elected leader” of the constituency and continued to be a minister till the formation of a new government. He reminded the SDM that could even take action against him.

“Try walking on that stretch. It is a matter of shame, that there is so much of dirt and filth in the mandi. So much of mud is present everywhere,” the SP leader is believed to have told Kumar.

Khan said that had he fallen on the muddy path, it would have created a scene.

“Kya isliye aapko transfer karwa ke laaye they? Aap kudey mein pade they (Was it for this moment that I had got you transferred here? You were in a garbage dump),” Khan allegedly said.

He went on to question the officer’s loyalties, asking him, “Yeh bhi Modiji ney kaha tha aisey laana hai (Did PM Narendra Modi say that I should be brought here in this manner?).”
