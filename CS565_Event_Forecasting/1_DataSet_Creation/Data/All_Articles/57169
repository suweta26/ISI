Kerala assembly slams RSS leader’s remark calling for CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s head 
6-3-2017 
The Kerala assembly on Monday passed a resolution condemning the statement of the RSS leader from Madhya Pradesh who announced a bounty of Rs1 crore on the head of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The resolution was introduced by state culture minister AK Balan and the Congress-led Opposition supported it.

Condemning the remark made by RSS leader Kundan Chandrawat, the resolution urged the government to take action against him.

Addressing a rally in Ujjain last week, Chandrawat had raked up a big controversy announcing a reward of Rs1 crore to anyone who killed the CM.

He made a scathing attack on Vijayan saying he was responsible for the death of RSS activists in Kerala.

“Cut off Vijayan’s head and bring it to me. I will transfer my house and all assets to you,” he had said
