In a first major shake-up in bureaucracy and police after Captain Amarinder Singh assumed office as the Chief Minister on Thursday, as many as 15 top IAS officers, including the Chief Secretary, and as many as 17 IPS officers, including the stateâ€™s intelligence chief, were shifted.

In a reshuffle of 20 more IAS officers, 18 were posted as deputy commissioners.

1984-batch IAS officer Karan Avtar Singh has been appointed as new Chief Secretary, replacing Kaushal, who now goes as Director General of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Public Administration (MGSIPA).

Gurkirat Kirpal Singh (2001-batch IAS officer) has been posted as Special Principal Secretary to the CM, while PCS officer Amrit Kaur Gill was appointed as Deputy Principal Secretary to the CM.

Dinkar Gupta, a 1987-batch IPS officer, has been appointed as ADGP intelligence, in place of 1992-batch IPS officer Gaurav Yadav, who has been transferred as ADGP (Administration).

Himmat Singh, one of the seniormost IAS officers of Punjab cadre who is considered close to Amarinder, has been appointed as Special Chief Secretary and given the charge of Horticulture Department.

Anurag Aggarwal has been appointed Financial Commissioner of Taxation and Vivek Pratap Singh Excise and Taxation Commissioner.

Tejvir Singh, another Punjab-cadre IAS officer considered close to Amarinder who was on central deputation, will be the new PS to the Chief Minister.
