With this, six persons named in the FIR against the 49-year-old SP leader have been picked up. “Today’s arrests were made from Hazratganj area in central Lucknow,” IG (Lucknow) A Satish Ganesh told PTI. Earlier Prajapati’s two aides were arrested from Noida near Jewar on the Yamuna Expressway on March 7. The minister’s security guard Chandrapal was arrested on March 6 near Lucknow Police lines. Prajapati was booked on a Supreme Court directive and an FIR was lodged on February 17 against the minister and six others for allegedly gang-raping a woman and alleged attempt to rape her minor daughter. The apex court had asked the UP Police to submit an action taken report regarding the incidents in eight weeks.
