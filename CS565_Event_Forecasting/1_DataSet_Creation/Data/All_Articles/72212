20-3-2017 
The Punjab government on Monday cancelled all labour and transportation tenders issued during the erstwhile SAD-BJP rule for the upcoming wheat procurement season. Fresh tenders have been invited, and deputy commissioners have been directed to personally supervise the procurement process that starts on April 1, a spokesperson said here.

In a meeting chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh it was decided that fresh tenders can be submitted by March 24. These will be opened the next day by the district tender allotment committees. The entire tendering process will be completed by March 31.

During the meeting held at the Punjab Bhawan here, CM Amarinder said officials should make all-out efforts to ensure timely and full procurement of every single grain from farmers, who had “suffered a harrowing time last year due to an ill-conceived agricultural policy of the erstwhile SAD-BJP government”.

The Punjab Mandi Board has been directed to make available electricity, moisture meters, tarpaulins, crates, power cleaners, fans, generators, in all the markets by March 24, Amarinder said.

The agencies would procure an estimated 122 lakh metric tonnes of wheat during this procurement drive.
