Two bombs exploded in Damascus on Saturday, with Al-Mayadeen TV channel stating that at least 40 people were killed in the explosions.

A report by the Syrian state news agency SANA said the bombs went off near a cemetery, in a rare attack on the Syrian capital.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a roadside bomb detonated as a bus passed and a suicide bomber blew himself up in the Bab al-Saghir area, which houses several Shia mausoleums that draw pilgrims from around the world.
