7-3-2017 
And the all new Swift is here.

Suzuki Motor Corp on Tuesday unveiled a facelift of its popular hatchback Swift at the Geneva International Motor Show on. And guess what? It’s coming to India early next year.

The third generation Swift is based on the company’s new generation Heartect platform, which is light weight and rigid.

“We have introduced advanced technology such as our new generation Heartect platform, our SVHS mild hybrid drivetrain and a new protective safety system in the new Swift,” Kanji Saito, executive general manager and managing officer, global automotive operations at Suzuki Motor Corporation, told reporters in Geneva.

The new Swift is 5% more fuel efficienct than the outgoing model as it weighs 120 kg lesser -- only 840 kg.

Swift was Suzuki’s first global strategic model launched in 2004, and has been its best seller since then, with more than 5.4 million units delivered to customers so far, he said.

Maruti Suzuki India brought Swift to India in 2005 and has been the hatchback segment leader since then, having sold over 1.5 million units.

“The new Swift will be launched in in the spring of 2018,” MSI executive director (Marketing and sales) RS Kalsi told PTI in Geneva.

The European variant of the hatch are expected to get 1.2 litre DDIS diesel and 1.0 litre Boosterjet engines. In India, Maruti Suzuki may retune the present mills -- 1.2 litre diesel and 1.3 litre petrol engines, but may also get a 1.0 litre Boosterjet engine, which the premium hatchback Baleno RS got last week.

The new Swift features Suzuki’s first use of an advanced forward detection system that combines a monocular camera and a laser sensor for advanced safety functions, including autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning and high beam assist. It also uses millimetre-wave radar to enable adaptive cruise control.
