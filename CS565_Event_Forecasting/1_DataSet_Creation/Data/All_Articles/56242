Sources here said the cause of the death was still unknown and the medical examiner’s office was investigating the incident which took place in Jersey city. Consulate officials have reached out to the deceased’s family in Massachusetts and sources said the family has requested privacy, saying “it is a personal family matter”.

The sources strongly cautioned that the incident should not be seen as linked to a possible hate crime since all details are still not available and the family too has termed it as a personal issue.
