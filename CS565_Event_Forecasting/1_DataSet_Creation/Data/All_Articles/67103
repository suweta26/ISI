A man, whose two brothers are in jail for allegedly raping a girl, pieced an eye of the victim with a big needle and damaged the other seriously in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday evening when the girl refused to withdraw the rape case, police said.

The man named Puttan was exerting pressure on the girl to withdraw the rape case filed against his brothers around a year back.

The girl had become pregnant after the alleged rape.

Neha Pandey, Unnao’s superintendent of police, said police teams were making efforts to arrest Puttan, who fled after committing the crime.

“The victim was taken to LLR hospital in Kanpur and a case is being registered with police in Maakhi,” she said.

The girl was attacked when she was on her way to attend to nature’s call in a nearby field.

She told police that Puttan followed her and told her to withdraw the case. When she refused, he attacked her with a stick.

He then tied a big needle on the tip of the stick and pierced one of her eyes with it. Some locals, who were near the scene of the crime, rushed to rescue her but the attacker managed to escape.

Ashok Singh, circle officer Safipur, said Puttan’s brothers were in jail and he was pressurising the woman to withdraw the case for a long time.
