“Some instances of nexus among politicians, bureaucrats and corporate houses have been reported. The existing statutes have adequate provisions to impart appropriate justice in such cases,” the minister said in a written reply.

To a query on whether allegations of online frauds against some companies have come to the notice of government, he replied in the affirmative. “Apart from Noida-based Ablaze Info Solution Pvt Ltd, one more company Webwork Trade Links Pvt Ltd has come to the notice for alleged online fraud,” Meghwal said.
