The launch of new Super4 series of televisions in India comes at a time when the company is struggling to meet its own targets. Chinese firm LeEco entered the Indian market in the beginning of last year with a range of new smartphones. Later in the year, the company launched a slew of smart TVs in India. However, things took an ugly turn when Jia Yueting, CEO and largest shareholder of LeEco, allegedly sent an alarming letter to all his employees.

In December, LeEco’s top-level executives in India — Atul Jain, chief operating officer of smart electronics business, and Debashish Ghosh, COO of Internet platform, services and content business, had been asked to resign. Last month., The Economic Times reported that the company was firing 85 per cent of its Indian workforce and was looking to exit is operations in the country. However, LeEco denied it leaving the Indian market and will continue to release new products.
