Mitchell Starc’s foot injury lands Australia in big trouble before Ranchi Test 
10-3-2017 
Mitchell Starc is going home dealing the Australian cricket team a massive blow ahead of the third India vs Australia Test starting in Ranchi on March 16.

Mitchell Starc is the second Australian cricketer to return injured. Mitchell Marsh was the first man on the injury list with an injured shoulder. Starc has a fractured foot.

Mitchell Starc was Australia’s main pace spearhead. His absence will hurt Australia, who lost the second Test by 75 runs. Australia had won the first Test in Pune.

Even though he has captured just five wickets in the first two Tests, his contribution with the bat has been significant.

It was Starc’s half-century in the first Test in Pune that helped his side take a formidable lead against the hosts and beat them by 333 runs.

It was a classic display of attacking cricket with the visitors reeling at 205 for the loss of nine wickets when he scored a quickfire 63-ball 61.

“Mitchell experienced some pain in his right foot during the second Test in Bangalore which unfortunately had not subsided a few days after the Test as we had hoped,” said team physiotherapist David Beakley.

“We made the decision to scan his foot in Bangalore this morning and unfortunately it has revealed a stress fracture.

“Subsequently, this means Mitchell will be unavailable for the remainder of the tour of India and will return home to Australia to start his rehabilitation.”

Mitchell Starc, known for his yorkers and reverse swing, suffered a stress fracture in his right foot during the inaugural day-night Test in Adelaide in November, 2015.

He had an ankle surgery the following month which ruined his season and the World T20 tournament in March, 2016.
