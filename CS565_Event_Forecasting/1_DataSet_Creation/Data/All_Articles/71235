Virat Kohli gives Australia a taste of their own medicine over injury ‘mockery’ 
19-3-2017 
India skipper Virat Kohli hit back at Australia over alleged mockery of his shoulder injury by gesturing at his shoulder as he gave David Warner a send-off after the latter’s dismissal during the closing stages of Day 4 during the third Test in Ranchi on Sunday.

Australia’s Glenn Maxwell had earlier been accused of mocking Kohli’s injury after he was seen playfully clutching his shoulder after taking a dive while the Indian skipper was batting during India’s first innings on Day 3.

Visiting skipper Steve Smith was also accused of the same after a cropped image did the rounds on social media, showing a hand on his shoulder immediately after Kohli’s dismissal on Saturday.

It later emerged that the hand on Smith’s shoulder was that of Peter Handscomb.

With India declaring their innings at a total of 603/9 on Sunday, having taken a lead of 152 runs, Kohli got his chance to hit back at the Australians when Ravindra Jadeja cleaned up David Warner early in the visitors’ innings.

The Indian skipper reacted to the dismissal by gripping his injured shoulder with his left hand, seemingly as a dig at Maxwell’s alleged mockery earlier in the match.

India, meanwhile, grabbed another wicket before stumps, with Jadeja knocking off nightwatchman Nathan Lyon’s off-stump in what turned out to be the last delivery of the match. Australia were 23/2 at the end of the day’s play, still trailing the hosts by 129 runs.
