4.25 pm: If you‚Äôre just joining us, BJP MLAs are arriving for the party legislature meeting in Lucknow to elect a new leader. Top picks for the post include Manoj Sinha, Rajnath Singh, BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya and Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath.

12:55 pm: IANS is reporting that Manoj Sinha is ‚Äòalmost‚Äô certain to be the CM. Many say only Amit Shah and PM Modi knows the name. So its kind of futile to speculate.

12:25 pm: By the way, supporters of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath are demanding his as chief minister. They are protesting in Lucknow.

12:22 pm: Is it infighting that‚Äôs troubling the BJP to come up with a name? Or is it caste calculations roiling the party? Time is ticking nevertheless.

Remember, in the recently-concluded elections, the BJP romped home winning 312 seats out of the state‚Äôs 403 seats. The SP-Congress alliance and the BSP tasted defeat.

While the BJP has named its CM candidate in neighbouring Uttarakhand, it has so far not announced its choice in UP. Some of the names doing the rounds are union ministers Rajnath Singh, Manoj Sinha, BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya and Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath.
