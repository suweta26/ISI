The George Campaign

Hundreds of followers of Socialist leader George Fernandes from various states, including trade unionists from Bombay, students and Lohiaite teachers from Delhi University and youthful supporters from elsewhere, have landed in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, to carry out a spirited campaign for George in his absence. Students of the Bihar University daily wheel around a tableau depicting a Tihar jail cell with a cardboard figure of George Fernandes in handcuffs behind iron bars. The handcuffs and prison bars also form the dominant theme of the Janata Party posters in this constituency. Alice Fernandes, mother of George Fernandes, is also here to campaign for her son. Her other son, Lawrence Fernandes, now out of jail, also arrived to lend a helping hand in electioneering for his brother, George, who, in absentia, is facing Congress and CPI nominees.
