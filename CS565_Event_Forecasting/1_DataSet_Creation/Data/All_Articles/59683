Hazarika said it was a proud moment for her to have received the coveted award and hoped this would inspire and motivate her to further the cause of women’s empowerment in the days ahead.

Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Leena Nair said the award instituted by Government of India is to honour women who have exceeded expectations to challenge the status quo and make a lasting contribution to women’s empowerment.

“The Government of India confers these awards on individuals and institutions in recognition of their service to the cause of women. Every year, the awards are an effort to recognize role models who act as catalysts of change for the younger generation,” Nair added.
