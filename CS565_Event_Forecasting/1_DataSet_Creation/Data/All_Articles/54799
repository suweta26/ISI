Now the exchange on this variant of the iPhone 7 Plus is around Rs 23,600, while on the iPhone 7 it is Rs 21,800. But once again you’re likely to get a higher exchange discount if you have an iPhone; pretty much every other phone listed on the Flipkart exchange is not going to fetch you more than Rs 9,000.

Apple iPhone 7 with 256 GB storage is priced at Rs 76,000, down from the original price of Rs 80,000. The exchange offer will get you a maximum of Rs 24,800 off on the price.

Now when buying the iPhone from Flipkart, stick with Flipkart Assured phones, and these are the ones that have a discount of five per cent on them. If you’ve been desperate to buy the iPhone 7, then five per cent price cut might make it seem like this is a good time to get the phone.

However, as far as price differences go, it is not really that much. Also the exchange offer seems tempting, but remember most phones won’t be fetching a high price, unless you are trading an old iPhone. If you are an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s users, then you can consider upgrading now.
