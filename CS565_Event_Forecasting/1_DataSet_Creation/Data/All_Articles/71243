An Indian-origin man is being sought in connection with what is believed to be a domestic incident that resulted in the death of a boy and injuries to a girl, Scotland Yard said on Sunday.

Releasing a photo of Bidhya Sagar Das, 33, Scotland Yard said the police were called to an address late on Saturday night at an address in Wilberforce Road, Finsbury Park, north London. The initial report received by the police referred to two injured children in the flat.

The boy and girl - both one-year-old - were taken by ambulance to an east London hospital, where the boy was pronounced dead early on Sunday. The girl remains in hospital in a critical condition, the police said.

The Yard said: “A murder investigation has been launched...Detectives are urgently trying to trace a man who was at the flat shortly before the injured children were found, but left before emergency services were called.”

“The man has not been seen since this time. He is Bidhya Sagar Das...The incident is believed to be domestic. There has been no arrest at this stage and enquiries continue,” it said, adding that the next of kin were aware of the incident.
