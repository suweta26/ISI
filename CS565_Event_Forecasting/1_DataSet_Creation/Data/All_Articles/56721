Leander Paes, Rohan Bopanna in Davis Cup team for Uzbekistan tie 
6-3-2017 
New Delhi: Ace India doubles specialist Leander Paes, and Rohan Bopanna were on Monday included in the six-member team for the upcoming Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone tie against Uzbekistan starting at Benguluru from April 7. There was much speculation with regard to the country’s best-ever doubles player, Paes, as former doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi had taken charge as non-playing captain.

However, the veteran’s name was included in the core group of players by the All India Tennis Association (AITA) selection committee which met here on Monday.

The other members of the team are Ramkumar Ramanathan, Yuki Bhambri, Prajnesh Gunneswaran and N Sriram Balaji.

Gunneswaran, the 27-year-old left-handed player from Chennai, who was a part of the Davis Cup team last year and made it to the Australian Open play-offs, was also a standby in the previous tie against New Zealand.

Bopanna, who was dropped from the side even though he was higher-ranked than Paes in the last tie in February against New Zealand, finally got back his place after his superb performance at the recently-concluded Dubai ATP 500 event, where he finished runners-up partnering Marcin Matkowski. In fact, the duo had also beaten Paes and his partner Gracia Gulliermo-Lopez in the semifinals.

Saketh Myneni, who had withdrawn from the tie against New Zealand, and Sumit Nagal had made themselves unavailable due to injuries. This made all three — Ramanathan, Yuki and Bopanna — automatic choice of the selectors.
