A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor was hacked to death on the outskirts of Bengaluru on Tuesday morning, police said.

The victim, Srinivas Prasad, alias Kithaganahalli Vasu, 38, was a councillor in the Bommasandra town municipal council. Police said unknown assailants attacked him with sickles near Bommasandra area.

Vasu sustained fatal injuries on his head and shoulders. Police sent the body for post-mortem.

“The victim was attacked at about 5:30 am when he was going for a morning walk,” said Amit Singh, superintendent of police for Bengaluru Rural.

Singh said the attack took place when Prasad got out of his car at a parking lot before heading for his morning walk.

The BJP lashed out at the state government over incidents of violence against its workers. BJP state unit president BS Yeddyurappa condemned the attack and said in a tweet that this was evidence of the death of law and order under the Congress rule.

BJP MLA BN Vijaykumar demanded the arrest of the culprits by this evening. “Otherwise, we will have to chalk out a counter strategy,” he said without elaborating on what this would entail.

Bengaluru had witnessed the killing of an activist of the Sangh Parivar last year. Rudresh, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist, too was hacked to death.
