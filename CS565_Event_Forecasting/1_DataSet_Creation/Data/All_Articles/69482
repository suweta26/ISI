Dr Jagat Ram is new director of PGIMER, Chandigarh 
17-3-2017 
Dr Jagat Ram took over as director of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, on Friday evening. He got the letter about confirmation from the Union ministry of health and family welfare in the evening and soon after he joined as director.

The institute was without a director for over a year. Dr Ram will remain director till October 30, 2021.

“I want to raise PGIMER to the next level, matching top global medical institutes in patient care, research and training. My goal is to provide the highest level of compassionate care, provide high-quality services to millions of patients, and reaching the unreached,” he said.

There were three contenders for the post and Dr Ram was the seniormost among them.

Controversy and what worked

On October 20, 2016, the selection committee chaired by CK Mishra interviewed 26 applicants to select the director. The committee came out with three names in order of preference — Dr Anil Bhansali, head of endocrinology at the PGIMER; Dr Meenu Singh, professor in the paediatrics department; and Dr Jagat Ram, head, Advanced Eye Centre.

Positioning of Dr Ram’s name at the lowermost position in the order of preference did not go well with many faculties. It became a talking point and many came in support of Dr Ram.

The faculties of PGIMER moved the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC).

Taking note of Dr Ram’s SC status, the commission said the selection process for PGI director is a “clear case of discrimination”. The NCSC directed the Union health secretary to review the selection process, so that “justice” is done.

Dr Ram did MBBS from Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) in 1978, followed by residency in ophthalmology (MS) at PGIMER, which he completed in June 1982.
