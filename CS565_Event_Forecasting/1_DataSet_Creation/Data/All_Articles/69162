A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting of Fishermen’s’ Associations here today, Rameswaram Fishermen’s Association President, S Emiret said.

The decision was taken keeping in mind the livelihood of the fishing community, he said. Fishermen of 13 districts including Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai and Nagapattinam had resolved to boycott fishing from March 6, to condemn the killing of 22-year-old Bridgo.

They staged demonstrations here demanding the Centre’s intervention in the matter.
