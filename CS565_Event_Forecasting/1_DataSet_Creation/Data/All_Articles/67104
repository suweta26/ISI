Top officials at Agra’s Ambedkar varsity come to blows over caste-based remark 
15-3-2017 
The registrar and deputy registrar of examination of Dr BR Ambedkar University in Agra exchanged blows in the senior official’s chamber on Wednesday afternoon, allegedly over a caste-based remark over an issue related to teachers selected for evaluating exam answer sheets.

The incident took place when deputy registrar Sindhi Ram reached the office of registrar KN Singh.

The deputy registrar was carrying a file related to a panel of teachers who are to evaluate answer sheets of exams. The registrar’s sanction was required for payments to be made to these teachers.

Sindhi Ram alleged he was abused and assaulted by the registrar, who denied the allegations and blamed the deputy registrar instead.

Vice-chancellor Arvind Kumar Dixit has now constituted a fact-finding committee to examine the issue on the basis of CCTV footage.

The sources said the registrar had asked for some more documents related to the file to which the deputy registrar had given some explanation that was reportedly unacceptable to the registrar. This led to a verbal duel that resulted in exchange of blows.

“I had gone to seek sanction on some file related to evaluation, but registrar KN Singh misbehaved with me, passed caste-based remarks and punched me,” alleged Sindhi Ram.

“The matter has been brought to vice-chancellor’s knowledge,” he said.

Sindhi Ram said he would file a police complaint under the Indian penal Code and the SC/ST Act.

Meanwhile, registrar Singh blamed the deputy registrar for attacking him and said the truth would be revealed by the CCTV footage from the camera placed in his office.

Dr Girija Shankar, spokesperson of the university, said, “The matter was brought to the notice of the V-C who constituted a fact-finding team that will look into the CCTV footage. Thereafter, legal recourse would be taken accordingly.”
