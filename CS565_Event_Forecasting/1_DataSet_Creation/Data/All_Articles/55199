Cash rewards and incentives amounting to at least Rs 3.5 crore were announced by the Haryana government after Sakshi created history at the Rio Games last year by becoming the first woman wrestler from India to win an Olympic medal.

Government of Haryana -- Sakshi’s state -- had announced before Olympics Rs 6 crore for gold medallists, Rs 4 crore for silver and Rs 2.5 crore for bronze winners. The 24-year-old girl from Rohtak had clinched a bronze medal in the 58kg freestyle category.
