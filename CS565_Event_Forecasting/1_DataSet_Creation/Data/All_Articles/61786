“Private recharge is aimed at letting customers retain their privacy by not sharing their numbers. The service was first launched in Kerala in August 2016 and is now available across 14 circles in the country. Pan-India roll-out will be completed within this month,” Idea Cellular said in a statement.

The service will be available at no extra cost. To avail the service Idea customer will need to send an SMS writing ‘Code’ to toll free number 55515 after which they will receive one-time password. The OTP can be then shared with the retailer instead of mobile number to get their phone recharged.

Both prepaid and postpaid Idea customers can avail this facility to recharge their phones and pay mobile bills, the statement said.
