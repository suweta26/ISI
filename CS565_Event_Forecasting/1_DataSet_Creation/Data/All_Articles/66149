15-3-2017 
After eight days, the strategic Jammu-Srinagar national highway was restored for one-way traffic on Wednesday as vehicles were allowed to move from Srinagar to Jammu.

Authorities had re-opened the highway for stranded vehicles yesterday evening and over 200 vehicles stranded between Ramban and Bannihal towns were allowed to move to the Valley.

“Traffic will move on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway from Jammu to Srinagar today,” traffic department officials said in winter capital Jammu.

“No vehicle will be allowed to move in the opposite direction. The restricti on will also apply to convoys of the army and the paramilitary forces,” the officials added.

As the highway remained closed due to landslides and road sinking in Panthal section of the road in Ramban district for several days, authorities arranged defence aircrafts to airlift stranded passengers between Srinagar and Udhampur yesterday.

The continued closure of the highway has resulted in shortages of mutton, poultry products and vegetables in the Valley.
