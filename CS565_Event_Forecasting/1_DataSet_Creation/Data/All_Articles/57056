Giriraj Singh asks Hindus to pray in temple instead of cutting cake on birthdays 
6-3-2017 
Union minister Giriraj Singh on Monday urged Hindus to take an oath to not cut cakes on birthdays, but offer prayers in a temple instead.

“I urge you all to take an oath not to cut a cake to celebrate birthdays, instead offer prayers in the temple to celebrate it. In Indian culture, there is no tradition to cut a cake. It is unfortunate that we are moving towards western culture despite the fact that our own culture is strong and old,” Singh said at a religious function in Bihar’s Aurangabad district.

Singh, who is minister of state for micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs), said Indian culture was ending fast in rural areas and it is a matter serious concern.

“These days children are addressing their mother as ‘mummy’ instead of ‘maa’ or ‘maiya’ and father as ‘papa’ instead of ‘babuji’ or ‘pitaji’. The words like ‘maiya’ and ‘babuji’ have an emotional connection,” he said.

Singh said our ancient religion is declining in the society due to carelessness to save ‘Sanatan Dharm Sanskriti’. “All Hindus should be united to protect our religion. Unless we are united, religion will not be saved.”

Singh reiterated that Muslims in India were not minority and hence should not be given that status.

The minister said that the Muslim population in the country stands at 21 crore, adding it is not proper to treat such a large population as minority. “There should be a debate over this issue in the country.”

Singh, a BJP Lok Sabha member from Nawada constituency in Bihar, is known as a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a champion of Hinduvta politics.
