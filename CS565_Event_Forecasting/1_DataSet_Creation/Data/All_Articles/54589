4-3-2017 
A day after Tamil radio host and singer Suchitra claimed that her Twitter account had been hacked, several allegations were again made from the account late on Friday night. Suchitra has been in the news for her recent tweets, mostly targeting actor Dhanush, radio jockey-turned-comedian RJ Balaji, singer Chinmayi and Vijay TV’s star host Dhivyadharshini.

Reacting to the buzz around her tweets, Suchitra’s husband and actor Karthik Kumar has issued a video where he explained the entire situation. “People have been mentioning her tweets in not so positive way. I have been honest enough to tel them, it is indicative of a certain emotional state we are all trying to understand and address,” he said.

“All the people mentioned in the tweets have been patient enough to understand that this could happen to anyone and to not take it personally. I really value all of that.There is nothing personal in all of this and it is more indictative of whatever condition she is going through,” Karthik said.

“I request members of the press not to go to town about this and not to take any of those ‘facts’ seriously. Please treat her like you would as a member of your own family,” he said.

After revealing pictures of actors Dhanush, Hansika Motwani, Andrea Jeremiah, music director Anirudh Ravichander and Dhivyadharshini from a private party, Suchitra had tweeted on Friday that her account was hacked.

In a series of tweets, Suchitra posted pictures that were allegedly taken from Dhanush’s phone then challenged Dhanush, Anirudh and Chinmayi to “deny this cheap act”. The account also shared a pornographic video followed by a tweet asking people to download the video before it is deleted. The account later switched to “protected” mode on Saturday morning.

Industry insiders had earlier told Hindustan Times that Suchitra is unhappy with her professional life, and hence, insinuating against her competitors and once-upon-a-time good friends, who are not helping her anymore.
