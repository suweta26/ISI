7-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: After days of hard campaign in Uttar Pradesh, PM Narendra Modi kicked off his two-day tour of Gujarat on Tuesday shifting his focus on his home state which goes to polls later this year.He inaugurated a four-lane bridge on Narmada, which will make the drive smoother on the Delhi-Mumbai highway. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a modern "bus port".The bridge and ancillary works have been completed in record 34 months and with nearly Rs 100 crore savings, highways minister Nitin Gadkari said.Modi took the opportunity to cite how his government had brought the focus on completing works on time and avoid cost overruns. "We are bringing the culture of completing projects on time... The model we had started in Gujarat is now spreading across the country," Modi said.Taking a dig at successive governments in Uttar Pradesh, he said they had forgotten completing work after laying the foundation stones.The PM said if there is good vision, right policy and good intent, people will support and success can be achieved.
