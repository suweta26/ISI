The second Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is balanced precariously at stumps on Day 4. Bangladesh would have been in a strong position had it not been for Dimuth Karunaratne’s impressive stay at the crease. He faced 244 balls and scored 126 runs before falling to Shakib al Hasan. Shakib, who scored a century during Bangladesh’s innings, was the joint highest wicket taker for Bangladesh alongwith Mustafizur Rahman with three scalps each.

Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh second Test, Day 4 highlights:

1708 hrs IST: Sri Lanka are down but not out. Not without a fight at least. Lakmal picks up a single and that brings up Sri Lanka’s 250. Lead up to 121 with two wickets left in the bag

1622 hrs IST: Herath and Perera keeping Sri Lanka battling. Lead nearing the 100-run mark

1558 hrs IST: GONE! Sri Lanka lose the big wicket of Karunaratne and it is Shakib Al Hasan with the wicket. Edged and taken by safe pair of hands in Soumya Sarkar. Pitched up outside off and Karunaratne is tempted into a shot and the ball doesn’t turn as much as he expected. Straightens and takes the outside edge which falls to Sarkar at first slip. Heroic knock of 126 runs from him

1552 hrs IST: Bangladesh take the new ball and Mustafizur is the first to use it. Three slips for Karunaratne. Sri Lanka’s idea has switched from quick runs after lunch to remaining steady at the moment. Perera has 4 runs from 63 balls. Karunaratne on 126 from 241 balls

1537 hrs IST: Sri Lanka have extended their lead to over 80 runs. Sri Lanka also crossed the 200-run mark in the third session with Dilruwan Perera sticking with Dimuth Karunaratne.

1500 hrs IST: Final session underway in Colombo and could decide if Bangladesh win this or not. 34 overs to be bowled, four wickets left for Bangladesh to pick up. Karunaratne brings up the 200 for the hosts and lead up to 71 runs

1440 hrs IST: TEA! Sri Lanka go into the tea break at 199/6 from 69 overs. Karunaratne on 110 runs and has Perera for company on 2. Hosts lead by 70 runs. 62 runs in that session with five wickets lost

1421 hrs IST: Sri Lanka have gone from 143/1 to 190/6 with Dickwella also back in the pavillion. That is five wickets between 47 runs. Hosts lead by 63 runs and B’desh have a great chance at levelling things in Colombo

1356 hrs IST: Dimuth Karunaratne brings up his century. He’s been the only positive light for Sri Lanka today. Niroshan Dickwella is the new man in and Sri Lanka have gone from a comfortable position to a tricky place. Mustafizur has the momentum for Bangladesh. Hosts lead by 59 runs

1315 hrs IST: GONE! Dinesh Chandimal walks back now with Mustafizur once again the wicket taker. Taken behind the stumps by Mushfiqur. Chases one outside off and edges it behind to the keeper. Chandimal tries to reach out to the full delivery and ends up paying for it. Asela Gunaratne is the new batsman in

1304 hrs IST: Dinesh Chandimal is the new man in to bat. Karunaratne on 89 now

1301 hrs IST: GONE! Mustafizur has caught the big fish in Kusal Mendis. Bangladesh have opted for a review for a caught-behind. Full delivery angling on and Mendis tries to play in the same fashion but the delivery straightens as the bat comes down. Third umpire thinks there is a noise. Not entirely convinced but the on-field decision has been overturned. Sri Lanka are 143/2

1208 hrs IST: LUNCH! Sri Lanka all along in that first session of play. They’re 137/1 as lunch is being taken in Colombo on the fourth day’s play. Now into an 8 run lead. Karunaratne on 67 and Mendis on 36

1109 hrs IST: Karunaratne picks up a single and Sri Lanka are on to 100/1 in the 28th over. Just 29 runs to clean from that Bangladesh lead

1045 hrs IST: DROPPED! Kusal Mendis survives and Mehedi Hasan could have had his second but for Imrul Kayes. Flighted outside off by Mehedi and Mendis tries to clip it but the ball travels quickly to Kayes at forward short leg. Doesn’t have enough time to react and hold on to it

1035 hrs IST: Kusal Mendis is the new man in for Sri Lanka. Off to a fairly decent start.

1005 hrs IST: GONE! Seventh delivery of the day and first from spin and Mehedi Hasan strikes to dismiss Upul Tharanga. The ball pitches on middle and leg, spins viciously to beat the outside edge and takes away the off-stump. Tharanga tried to play for the angle but the ball just keeps going away from him

1000 hrs IST: Hello and good morning on this fourth day of the second Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Colombo. Still plenty in it for the spinners and if they can get the ball to move around the off stump of both left and right hand batsmen, it could spell trouble says Russell Arnold in his pitch report
