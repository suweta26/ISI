Live cricket score, India vs Australia, 3rd Test, Day 3: Murali Vijay eyes fifty 
18-3-2017 
With skipper Virat Kohli still nursing a shoulder injury, the real worth of India’s top order will be tested on day 3 of the third India vs Australia Test in Ranchi today. India mounted a positive reply after Steve Smith’s unbeaten 178 and Glenn Maxwell’s maiden century powered Australia to a series-high 451 on day two of the third test on Friday. India start at 120 for one with Murali Vijay unbeaten on 42 and Cheteshwar Pujara on 10. Catch live cricket score of India vs Australia here. (LIVE SCORECARD | WHERE TO SEE LIVE STREAMING)

On a wearing Day 3 Ranchi wicket, India’s batsmen will have to negotiate a ball that is 40 overs old. Even though Pat Cummins got the better of KL Rahul with a ball that rose sharply, skipper Steven Smith will bank on his spin troika of Nathan Lyon, Steve O’Keefe and Glenn Maxwell to find the breakthroughs. Smart fielding will be crucial.

As was predicted by the experts, the Ranchi wicket is not a horror pitch. With more than 570 runs scored over two days, Ranchi can still produce more runs, should batsmen apply themselves like Smith and Maxwell did.

Saturday should see a good contest between bat and ball.
