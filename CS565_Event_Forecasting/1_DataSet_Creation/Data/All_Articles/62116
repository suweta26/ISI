Deepika Padukone: I don’t look at Hollywood and Bollywood as separate careers 
10-3-2017 
Working in a Hollywood film has been “enriching” for her. Ask Deepika Padukone how she plans to use her experience in the West in Bollywood and she says, “In the same way, I use my film experience from here [Bollywood] in Hollywood. The reason I am able to do what I do in a film like xXx: Return of Xander Cage and be applauded for it, is because of the experience I have had over here.”

The Bajirao Mastani (2015) actor adds that she “might have had experiences or learnt things” in Hollywood that she might bring back to Bollywood. “But a film set is a film set, and nothing changes. The creative process is the same. I don’t look at them as separate careers. For me, it’s a part of the same journey,” she says.

Deepika Padukone made her Hollywood debut with XXX: Return of Xander Cage.

Deepika is “sure” that her stint “has been enriching in so many ways.”

“I may not realise that now, but maybe when I walk on to the sets of Padmavati, there will be a moment when I might surprise myself. It might happen in this film, or two years later. So, something that is taken out of this experience may translate into something much later on. Be it professionally or personally — travelling the world, meeting so many people, being exposed to new cultures and just seeing their style of working — all of it has been enlightening,” she says.
