NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry has drawn up a Draft Criminal Law Amendment Bill 2016, seeking to make bribery during polls a cognizable offence under sections 171 E and 171F of the IPC and enhancing maximum punishment under this provision to 3 years from the existing one year.This follows a letter written by Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi to Union home minister Rajnath Singh in December 2016, proposing the above two amendments as part of reforms to tackle bribery of voters during polls.Sources in the election commission revealed that the bill was circulated to the states for their comments in February.As per law, 50% of the states must give their consent for the draft bill to be moved in Parliament.
