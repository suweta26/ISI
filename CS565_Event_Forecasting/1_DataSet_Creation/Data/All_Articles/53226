2-3-2017 
AMRELI POLICE and district administration heaved a sigh of relief as family members of Dalit sarpanch Jaysukh Madhad, who was allegedly murdered over an old dispute, claimed his body and performed last rites after authorities assured them of a fair probe in the case. Madhad, 30, sarpanch of Varasda village of Amreli taluka, was allegedly stabbed to death on Tuesday by three men of the same village over a tiff which had started after Madhad’s victory in the village panchayat body in December last year. But Madhad’s family refused to claim the body, demanding that all the accused be arrested first. Police had arrested Deep Dhadhal, one of the three accused, on Wednesday. But the family had continued their protest. Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and former BJP MLA Siddharth Parmar met the victim’s family and expressed their support.
