Punjab higher education minister Syed Raza Ali Gilani’s proposal to make hijab mandatory for government college girls and offering them “extra” marks for covering themselves up has set off a furore.

“Observance of hijab should be made mandatory for college girls,” The Express Tribune quoted Gilani as saying while addressing the Lahore board’s divisional directors on Tuesday.

He added that hijab-wearing students, who fail to fulfil the required attendance, would benefit from the education department’s decision as five percent grace marks would be accorded to them.

However, the Punjab government on Tuesday denied having made the hijab mandatory for girls at the province’s colleges.

“This is absolutely wrong news. No such policy [has been announced] by the government of Punjab,” the Punjab government said on twitter.

Information secretary Raja Jahangir said: “No such summary has been received by the provincial cabinet from the higher education department.”

He said the minister could not make such rules on his own without getting the approval from the cabinet.
