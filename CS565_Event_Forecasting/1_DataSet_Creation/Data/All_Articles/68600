Indian markets are likely to open flat on Friday to hover around previous day’s record highs, tracking Asian and US bourses as dollar continue to slide following Federal Reserve’s signal of a gradual rate hike and other major central bankers maintaining status quo.

On Thursday, Nifty closed at an all-time high 9,153.70 while Sensex too was at the peak level at 29,585.85.

On Wednesday, Fed hiked key policy rates by 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage point to a range of 0.75-1.00% while China’s PBOC hiked rates, Bank of Japan and Bank of England maintained status quo.

Global investors took comfort from the Fed stance of a slower pace of tightening going forward. Earlier, market experts were expecting rapid rate hikes that could have led to capital outflow from riskier assets and emerging markets.
