US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has made clear to his counterparts the condolences of the US over the recent alleged racial attacks, State Department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner said.

“So I don’t really want to speak to what may or may not have been the motivation behind these killings, but certainly, we share in the sorrow of the families and loved ones of these victims,” he said.

An Indian engineer, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was shot in Kansas in an alleged racial attack on February 22, after the gunman was heard shouting “get out of my country”. The gunman, Adam Purinton, a 51-year-old Navy veteran, was arrested later.

Harnish Patel, a 43-year-old Indian-origin store owner in South Carolina also was shot dead outside his home in Lancaster County, while a Sikh man was shot at in his driveway in Kent, Washington district by a masked assailant who shouted at him to “go back to your own country”.
