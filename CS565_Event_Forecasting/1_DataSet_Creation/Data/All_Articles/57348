NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved on Monday the proposal for revival of 50 unserved/under-served airports/airstrips of state governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and civil enclaves in three financial years starting from 2017-18."The total cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 4,500 crore. Fifteen airports/airstrips each would be revived during 2017-18 and 2018-19 each while 20 airports/airstrips would be revived during 2019-20," said a government statement."As an outcome of the approval, small cities/towns shall be connected on commencement of operation of flights to under-served/unserved airports . It will further boost the economic development in these areas as well as surrounding areas in terms of job creation and related infrastructure development," said the statement.The revival of airstrips/airports will be "demand driven", depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the state governments for providing various concessions as airports will be developed without insisting on financial viability.
