16-3-2017 
Chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ rang out in the Rajasthan assembly on Thursday as the BJP legislators celebrated the party’s massive victory in the just-concluded Uttar Pradesh elections.

During the Question Hour, Speaker Kailash Meghwal congratulated minister for women and child development Anita Bhadel for being conferred with President’s award for exemplary work for uplift of women.

Soon after, the parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore drew attention of the House asking the Opposition to congratulate them for a historic win in the state assembly elections, especially in reference to Uttar Pradesh.

This led to a verbal altercation between legislators from the ruling BJP and the Opposition. Amid uproar, a few BJP members in the House shouted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans.

This lasted for a few minutes following which the Speaker initiated with business of the House.

The BJP had won 312 of the 403 assembly seats in UP, the largest and politically crucial state in India.

Among the five states, where elections were held, BJP secured two-third majority in UP and Uttarakhand and has formed governments in Goa and Manipur with the help of smaller parties and Independents.
