Search engine Google marked the International Women’s Day by putting together a Doodle slideshow to celebrate some of influential women on Wednesday.

Women’s Day is celebrated across the world on March 8.

It showcased images of 13 remarkable women, each of whom have “made a mark in her own way”.

“They pursued a range of professions and passions and hailed from an array of backgrounds and countries. In fact, all of these women have been featured in individual doodles in the past, but often only in their countries of origin. So today we’re taking the opportunity to share their stories with everyone.”

The stories take a grandchild into an imaginary world where she encounters thirteen women -- a pilot, a singer, an astronaut, a classical dancer, a scientist, a doctor, a lawn tennis player and others.

On February 28, 1909, the Socialist Party of America observed the first known Women’s Day in New York.

On March 8, 1917, a Women’s Day demonstration sparked the Russian Revolution and the day was eventually declared as national holiday in Russia in 1965.

In 1977, the UN adopted March 8 as the International Women’s Day and since then it celebrates women’s rights and world peace.
