10-3-2017 
The Parliamentary Board of the BJP may meet on Saturday afternoon when results of the five state assembly elections will be out.

With exit polls projecting a good show by the saffron party, including in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh where it is projected to emerge as the single largest party, its highest decision-making body is likely to take stock of the situation and chalk out future strategy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah are among the boardâ€™s 12 members who also include Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Ananth Kumar, Thawarchand Gehlot and J P Nadda.

A party source said the meeting has been tentatively scheduled for Saturday. However, there is a possibility that it could be held on Sunday depending on how the results pan out.

The counting of votes will start Saturday morning.

Exit polls had on Thursday projected a hung assembly in Uttar Pradesh, with BJP likely to lead the table, winning anywhere between 164 and 210 of the 403 seats. They also projected a good show by the party in Goa and Uttarakhand.
