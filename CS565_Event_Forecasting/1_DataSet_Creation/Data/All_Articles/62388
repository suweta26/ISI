“Many financial institutions have not returned the maturity amount to the depositors and as there was no law to curb the menace. The bill was introduced for this purpose only,” the minister said. Responding to queries made by education Parliamentary Secretary Pani Taram and BJP members Japu Deru and Karya Bagang, Waii said there were 28 cases being registered in the state out of which 13 were under investigation.

“The Special Investigation Team constituted by the Home department will investigate all cases of economic offence and there are provisions for punishment in the form of two year imprisonment and penalty of Rs five lakh,” he said. The bill was later on passed in the House by voice vote.
