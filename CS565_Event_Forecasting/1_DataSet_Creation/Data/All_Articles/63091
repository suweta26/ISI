Buoyed by BJP’s stunning victory in Uttar Pradesh assembly poll, the party’s senior Bihar leader Sushil Kumar Modi thanked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for not contesting in the state, which, he said, helped his party to come to power.

“Nitish Kumar not fighting UP elections also helped BJP. Thanks to Nitishji,” he said.

The senior party leader took a dig at RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav saying, “If Lalu Prasadji would not have gone to UP and abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Samajwadi Party could have gained 2-4 seats.”

Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the party’s strong showing in the high-stakes UP assembly polls, he said the resounding victory is a result of his policies such as demonetisation.

“Victory of BJP in UP is victory of NaMo and demonetisation,” he tweeted.

Showering praise on BJP national president Amit Shah, Sushil Modi in another tweet said Shah is “the man of the match”.

“UP was able to counter anti-Reservation and outsider tags which we couldn’t do in Bihar,” he said.
