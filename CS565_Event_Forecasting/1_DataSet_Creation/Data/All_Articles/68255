A 17-year-old boy was detained on Thursday for allegedly raping and impregnating a teenage girl who had delivered a baby girl last month in Hyderabad, police said.

The boy and the girl, also aged around 17, were classmates of intermediate first year in a college in Hyderabad.

“Following information that she had delivered a baby girl last month at a state-run hospital, the police registered a case under IPC section 376 (rape) against the boy and he has been apprehended,” Alwal Police Station Inspector T Anand Reddy told PTI.

Meanwhile, a city-based child rights NGO ‘Balala Hakkula Sangham’ demanded an in-depth inquiry into the case alleging that there was negligence on part of the officials of the Police and Women & Child Welfare departments in not rescuing the new born and her mother. Further probe is on.
