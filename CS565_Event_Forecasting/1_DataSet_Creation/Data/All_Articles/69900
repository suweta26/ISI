Lille and Marseille played out a lackluster goalless draw in the French league on Friday.

The result left Marseille fifth in the standings, 22 points off leader Monaco’s pace, with Lille lagging 34 points behind.

The host had the match’s best chance with six minutes left but forward Eder’s header was parried away off the crossbar by goalkeeper Yohann Pele.

The game marked Marseille coach Rudi Garcia’s return to his former club.

Lille is coached by Franck Passi, the man Garcia replaced at Marseille after American billionaire Frank McCourt’s takeover.

Garcia spent five years as Lille coach, leading the club to a league and cup double in 2011. He went on to coach Roma in Serie A.

METZ 1, BASTIA 0

Metz ended a five-match winless run to move seven points clear of the relegation zone.

The host had the best chances and forced Bastia keeper Jean-Louis Leca to a couple of good saves before Gilles Cioni scored an own goal in the 47th minute when Lindsay Rose’s clearance hit the defender and went in.

It was Cioni’s maiden goal in the topflight.

Bastia had only three shots during the whole game, and none of them was on target. The Corsican side remains in the danger zone, three points above last-placed Lorient.
