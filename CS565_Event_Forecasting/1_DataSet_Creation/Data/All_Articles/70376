Romelu Lukaku struck a late double as Everton’s challenge to join the Premier League top-four battle strengthened with a 4-0 rout of relegation-haunted Hull City for a sixth successive home win on Saturday. Dominic Calvert-Lewin finished off a fine Everton move after eight minutes to slot home his first top-flight goal. Everton dominated but Hull stayed in the game until 15 minutes from time when midfielder Tom Huddlestone was shown a straight red card for a foul on Idrissa Gueye.

It got worse for Hull almost immediately as substitute Enner Valencia doubled Everton’s lead following good build-up play from leading scorer Lukaku. There was still time for Lukaku to pounce for a quickfire brace in stoppage time, taking his league goal tally for the season to a chart-topping 21.

Everton moved above Manchester United into sixth place, level on 50 points with Arsenal who have two games in hand. United face Middlesbrough on Sunday.
