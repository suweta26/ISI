PV Sindhu storms into All England Open Rd 2 with win over Mette Poulsen 
8-3-2017 
Sixth seed PV Sindhu was off to a flying start in the women’s singles of the All England Open in Birmingham defeating Denmark’s Mette Poulsen 21-10, 21-11 in just 29 minutes.

The world No. 5 Sindhu, who is now India’s top ranked player after winning silver at the Rio Olympics in August last year, sealed the match with a forehand crosscourt. Sindhu hit 42 winners in the match where she did not let the Dane get a footing in the game at the Barclaycard Arena on Wednesday.

The All England Open presents a perfect opportunity for the two-time World Championship bronze medallist to further elevate her profile and India hope she becomes the first woman from the country to lift the title.

Only two Indians, Prakash Padukone and current chief coach P. Gopichand have won titles at the All England Open.

In earlier matches, men’s doubles pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy lost to qualifying pair of Peter Briggs and Tom Wolfenden of England 19-21, 21-10, 18-21.

The women’s doubles pair of Jakkampudi Meghana and Poorvisha S Ram too lost to Chinese Taipei’s Hsu Ya Ching and Wu Ti Jung 19-21, 12-21.

Later in the evening, eighth seed Saina Nehwal, who overcame a career-ending knee injury, will meet World No.11 and defending champion Nozomi Okuhara of Japan in the first round. The 2012 London Olympic bronze medallist was a runner-up in 2015 and there may not be a better tournament than All England to showcase that her troublesome days are well and truely over.

The Japanese shuttler has faced her Indian opponent on six previous occasions, winning only once at the World Superseries Finals in 2015.

After the surgery, she has also won Malaysian Masters Grand Prix Gold that indicates that her comeback has been smooth and she will be hungry to continue that. But Saina is aware that the standard of play here will be much more demanding than the Malaysian event and she has to be ready.
