Exit polls: BJP maybe single-largest party in UP assembly elections 
9-3-2017 
The BJP could emerge as the single-largest party in Uttar Pradesh, two exit polls predicted on Thursday, giving the saffron party an advantage in what could turn out to be a hung assembly. Official results are out on March 11.

The India News-MRC poll gave the BJP 185 seats, the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance 120 and the Bahujan Samaj Party 90 in a 403-member assembly. The halfway mark is 202.

The Times Now-VMR poll gave the BJP between 190 and 210 seats, the SP-Congress combine between 110 and 130 seats and the BSP between 57 and 74 seats.

Exit polls have a mixed record, having got it wrong in the Bihar and Delhi polls in 2015.
