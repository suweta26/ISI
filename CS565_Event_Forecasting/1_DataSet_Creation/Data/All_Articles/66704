The Sports Ministry, in principle, has agreed to the proposal of the Indian Olympic Association to bid for hosting the 132nd session of the International Olympic Committee in the National Capital Region in 2019.

“This has the approval of Honorarable Minister of State (I/C), Youth Affairs & Sports,” the letter from central government’s under secretary A K Patro stated.
