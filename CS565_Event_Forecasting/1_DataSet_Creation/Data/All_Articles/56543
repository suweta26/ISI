Posters declaring Rs 50,000 reward on Gayatri Prajapati appear in UP’s Allahabad

Posters have sprung up across Allahabad offering Rs 50,000 to anyone with information leading to the arrest of Uttar Pradesh minister Gayatri Prajapati who is absconding after a woman accused him of rape.

Photographs of the posters are also being widely circulated on messaging app WhatsApp and social media, adding to the swirling rumours about the powerful Samajwadi Party minister in the middle of the assembly elections in the state.

Prajapati is the SP’s candidate in Amethi.

The government revoked the passport of Prajapati for four weeks after the Supreme Court asked police to register an FIR against the minister.

The posters are also taunting the SP government, saying “lost buffaloes” of minister Azam Khan can be recovered by police who have, however, failed to trace a tainted minister.

Golu Sonkar, the leader of a social organisation, which has put up the posters said women are not safe under Samajwadi Party rule.

“Chief minister (Akhilesh Yadav) is trying to save Gayatri Prajapati,” he added.
