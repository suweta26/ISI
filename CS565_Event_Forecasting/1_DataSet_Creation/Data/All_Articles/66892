15-3-2017 
A court at Pauri (Rishikesh), in Uttrakhand, on Wednesday, granted the Patna Police three-day transit remand of absconding automobile showroom owner Nikhil Priyadarshi and his father, retired IAS officer Krishna Bihari Prasad.

Named in a widely-reported case from Bihar, Priyadarshi and his friends are accused of supplying girls to high profile politicians in Bihar and bureaucrats and of sexually exploiting the teenage daughter of a former minister on the promise of marriage.

The father-son duo, absconding since December 22, were arrested on Tuesday by personnel of the Chilla police Chowki under Lakshman Jhoola police station during a routine vehicle checking drive.

"After their arrest, two officials of Patna police reached there and on Wednesday the duo was produced in court, which granted three-day transit remand to police," the official said. Priyadarshi and his father are expected to reach Patna on Thursday.

Apart from the duo, former Bihar Congress vice president Brajesh Pandey, Manish Priyadarshi and Sanjit Sharma are also named accused in the high profile case in which the accused are also charged with threatening the victim girl.

The victim had accused the Priyardarshi also running a sex racket in collusion with other high profile businessmen including some political leaders and police official. The case had surfaced in December last year.
