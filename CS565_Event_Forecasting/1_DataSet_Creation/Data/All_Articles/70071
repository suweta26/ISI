Moving around for the visually impaired could become a lot easier if an innovative technology developed by Anang Tadar, a class 11 student from Arunchal Pradesh, is mass produced.

The technology, which is based on echo location—similar to what bats use for navigation—was adjudged the most innovative at the regional level science festival, which concluded in Guwahati recently.

Named Goggle for Blind (G4B), the pair of glasses can be worn by the visually impaired, and using technology similar to parking sensors in cars, they can be alerted about nearby objects, without using a stick.

“These days there are so many obstructions both inside the house and outside. The G4B will help blind people move around a lot easier,” Tadar told journalists in Itanagar.

The student, who loves making robots and gadgets, told Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu on Friday that he was motivated to develop the product after he saw a blind girl a few years ago.

According to a release by the Arunachal Pardesh government, impressed with the innovation, UNICEF has asked Tadar to develop few more prototypes. The initial product is a bit bulky, so the aim is to make it lighter.

Tadar had participated in the national level science exhibition earlier this month at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi organised by the National Innovation Foundation (NIF).

The Arunachal Pradesh government has assured all financial support to Tadar so that he can fine tune his innovation to make it easier to handle and is able to produce it on a large scale.
