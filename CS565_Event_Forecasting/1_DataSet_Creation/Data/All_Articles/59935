Migrants’ influx: SC asks Centre to release funds for Indo-Bangla border fencing 
8-3-2017 
The Supreme Court asked the Centre on Wednesday to release funds for the fencing of India-Bangladesh border to prevent a cross-border influx of illegal Bangladesh nationals.

The bench also fixed April end as the deadline for the Hajela committee to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to identify the original residents of Assam.

When Prateek Hajela, who is also coordinating the committee for Assam, informed the bench that the task would take time, the court told the state government to cooperate.

“Whatever manpower and money it requires, you must give it,” the bench said.
