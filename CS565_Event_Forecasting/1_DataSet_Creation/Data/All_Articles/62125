A London-bound Air India aircraft from Ahmedabad on Friday had to be escorted by fighter jets after it lost contact with the Air Traffic Control while flying over Hungary.

The plane, with 231 passengers and 18 crew members onboard, lost contact with the ATC due to “frequency fluctuation”, an Air India spokesperson said.

The aircraft, which took off from the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai at 0700 hours, landed safely at London’s Heathrow Airport at 11.05 hours, the spokesperson said.
