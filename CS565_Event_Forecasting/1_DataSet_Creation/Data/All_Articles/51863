“In its February 17, 2013 order, the court directed petitioners appear before court on March 1. Following directive, Chief Engineer RP Sinha and ex-managing director PK Asudani of UP Jal Nigam appeared before the court on Wednesday. UP Jal Nigam chairman Azam Khan, who is petitioner no 1, could not appear in court….,” said government counsel IP Singh.

The court stated in its order, “…we find it surprising that petitioner no. 1 on its own has defied Court’s order …This conduct on the part of petitioner no.1 holding a high office of Chairman of a statutory body i.e. U.P. Jal Nigam is very disturbing…Let bailable warrant be issued against petitioner No.1…”
