Jimmy Butler scored 22 points as the Chicago Bulls beat Golden State 94-87 on Thursday night in the Warriors’ first game since Kevin Durant injured his left leg.

Golden State was breathing a little easier after learning Durant probably will play again this season. He was hurt two nights earlier in a loss at Washington.

The NBA-leading Warriors’ league-record regular-season streak without consecutive losses ended at 146 games.

Stephen Curry scored 23 points, and Klay Thompson finished with 13. The star guards combined to shoot just 3 of 22 on 3-pointers, and the Warriors made it back-to-back losses for the first time since April 2015.

Bobby Portis added 17 points and a season-high 13 rebounds for Chicago. The Bulls outscored Golden State 10-2 over the final three minutes to wipe out a one-point deficit and come away with their fifth win in six games.

SUNS 120, HORNETS 103

Marquese Chriss scored 17 points and Phoenix shot a season-best 59.7 percent from the field against Charlotte.

Chriss shot 6 of 9 and missed roughly a full quarter after straining a calf early in the first.

T.J. Warren added 16 points and eight rebounds, and Alan Williams had 16 points and 12 rebounds, including a layup with 2:46 to play that made it 114-99.

Leandro Barbosa also had 16 points, and Devin Booker had 15 points, nine assists and six rebounds.

Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 26 points.

TRAIL BLAZERS 114, THUNDER 109

Damian Lillard had 33 points, including a key 3-pointer with just under three minutes to go, and Portland rallied to beat Oklahoma City.

Russell Westbrook scored 45 points on 12-of-36 shooting for the Thunder, who had their four-game winning streak snapped. Oklahoma City newcomer Taj Gibson added 15 points, including a high-arching buzzer-beater from 61 feet away to put the Thunder up 60-57 at halftime.

Alex Abrines’ 3-pointer put the Thunder in front 97-89 with 7:48 left for their biggest lead, but Al-Farouq Aminu made a layup that tied it at 101 with 3:43 to go. He missed the free throw, but Jusuf Nurkic got the tip-in to give Portland the lead.

Lillard’s 3-pointer extended the advantage to 106-101.

Abrines’ 3-pointer with 17.7 seconds left narrowed it to 110-109. Lillard was fouled twice in the final seconds and made all four free throws before Westbrook and Doug McDermott missed 3-pointers at the end.

Westbrook hit all 15 of his free throws. He had eight rebounds and four assists, ending a streak of four straight triple-doubles.
