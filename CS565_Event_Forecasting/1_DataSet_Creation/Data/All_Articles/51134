Katrina Kaif set the couch on fire along with Anushka Sharma in Karan Johar’s popular chat show, where she admitted that she is quite asocial and can’t mingle around freely. So it wasn’t surprising that the ‘Baar Baar Dekho’ actress wasn’t spending the festive season with any of her B-town friends. Instead, Katrina has headed back home to London.



We came across some pictures where you can see the ‘Jagga Jasoos’ actress having a swell time with her family in the British capital. Wearing a military green fur coat and cap, Kat looks adorable while learning how to shoot a rifle. Now you know why the actress wasn’t spotted at the 51st birthday bash of Salman Khan.
