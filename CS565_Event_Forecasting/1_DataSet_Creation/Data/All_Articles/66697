To encourage e-transaction, he said more common service centers (CSC) will be set up for payment of utility bills through debit or credit cards.

“We have set up 2 lakh CSC. We will take (the number) to 2.5 lakh this year,” he added.

With growing number of e-transactions, Prasad said there is a dilemma how to strike a balance between maintaining privacy of data and at the same time using it for providing better service.

He was speaking on the theme ‘Consumer rights in a digital age’. Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs C R Choudhary, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande, Nasscom President R Chandrashekar were among others present at the event.
