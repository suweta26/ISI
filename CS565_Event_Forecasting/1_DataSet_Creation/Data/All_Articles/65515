An elderly farmer was mauled to death by stray dogs at Sallopur village in Kahnuwan area of Gurdaspur district on Monday afternoon. Victim Jagat Singh, 83, was working in the field alone when the pack of dogs attacked him unprovoked.

His cries were unheard, the body remained in the fields until a villager happened to pass by and spot it on the evening. The body was brought for post-mortem to the civil hospital in Gurdsapur, and the cremation took place in his village on Tuesday.

This is the third recent incident of stray dogsâ€™ murderous attack on humans in the Majha region. In Tarn Taran, a four-year-old child was killed by stray dogs at Kaironwal village on February 16. Two weeks after that, another child of the same age was attacked by dogs at Sarhali Kalan village of the same district where over 200 incident of dog bite are reported every month. Sustaining serious injuries on his face, the child remained hospitalised for many days.
