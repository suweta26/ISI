China aims for around 6.5% economic growth in 2017

China is aiming to expand its economy by around 6.5% in 2017, Premier Li Keqiang said in remarks prepared for delivery at the opening of the annual meeting of parliament on Sunday.

That compares with a 2016 economic growth target of 6.5 to 7%.

Top leaders at the National People’s Congress are tolerating slightly slower economic growth this year to give them more room to push through some painful reforms to deal with a rapid build-up in debt.

A lending binge and increased government spending last year have fuelled worries about high debt levels and an overheating housing market.

China’s gross domestic product grew 6.7% in 2016, the slowest in 26 years.
