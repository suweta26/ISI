7-3-2017 
A terror module with suspected ISIS links was behind the bomb blast in a Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train that injured nine persons near Jabdi station in Shajapur district of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday morning, police said.

The incident site is around 80 km west of Bhopal.

This is the first time that any ISIS-linked terror module has been suspected of carrying out an operation in Madhya Pradesh.

A high alert has been sounded across the state after the explosion and four suspects have been picked up for interrogation.

IG (Law and Order) Makrand Deouskar said the explosion was caused by a pressure pipe bomb filled with ammonia nitrate kept inside a bag on the luggage rack.

Soon after the blast at around 8.50 am, DGP Rishi Kumar Shukla and ADG intelligence Rajiv Tandon rushed to the spot along with other senior officials.

Sources maintain that the explosives were meant to be used elsewhere, most probably in Uttar Pradesh that goes to polls tomorrow. It went off accidentally, sources said, adding that had the plan was to trigger the blast in the train, the explosives would have been kept under the seat for greater impact.

Sources said police started scanning the CCTV footage at the Bhopal railway station and they identified four suspects who were going towards the bus stand.

They were picked up from Pipariya in Hoshangabad district. Police believe of them three were certainly involved in the blast. The suspects are from UPâ€™s Aligarh and Kanpur.
