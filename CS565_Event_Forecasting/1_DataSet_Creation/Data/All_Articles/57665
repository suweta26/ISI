Geneva Motor Show Live: Tata Motors unveils connected car TAMO Futuro 
7-3-2017 
Tata Motors is all set to showcase a concept sports car Futuro under its sub-brand TAMO at the Geneva International Motor Show on Tuesday.

The TAMO product will be a low-slung sports concept with sleek LED lights, premium interiors and packed with technology as the automaker claims.

A sneak peak shows that the car has carbon-fibre body and gets 14-spoke alloy wheels with discbrakes.

Tata Motors, India’s largest carmaker by revenue, calls this TAMO concept as its first “Connected car”, after developing a driver-assistance interface in partnership with Microsoft, much on the lines of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

Tata Motors says TAMO is an open platform for innovators to develop “transportation for the future”. It is a separated vertical, which will initially operate on a low volume, low investment model for fast-tracked development of technologies and concepts.
