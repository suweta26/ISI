Kerala’s CPI-M working in league with Islamic State, jihadi groups: Goa RSS 
1-3-2017 
Kerala’s rulling Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) is in league with jihadi groups and the IS in order to prevent the growth of the RSS in the southern state, claims RSS wing Goa Janadhikar Samiti.

The charge, made in a memorandum addressed to President Pranab Mukherjee, was released to media late Wednesday by members of the Samiti led by state RSS chief Laxman Behare, who said that the Left cadre in Kerala was being “intolerant” to RSS-Bharatiya Janata Party workers, as well as members of other political outfits.

“It is not a secret that the hardcore jihadi groups are now hand in gloves with CPI-M in preventing growth of RSS. The arrest of group of militants with Islamic State connections at Kanakmala in Kannur district reveals that the safest place for their work in communist stronghold,” said the memorandum, which was formally submitted on Wednesday to Goa governor Mridula Sinha to be on passed to the President.

“Kanakmala is a hill top surrounded by places of CPI-M stronghold. If the CPI-M were to be vigilant against terrorism, these militants would not have reached Kanakmala. It is an open secret, that the CPI-M sought help of all jihadi Groups to come to power in Kerala,” the memorandum also said, requesting the President to use his good office to “stop these politically motivated murderous attacks and establish peace and amity in the state of Kerala”.
