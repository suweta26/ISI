Raids at Chennai port to combat smuggling of fake currency into India 
20-3-2017 
The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and customs officials conducted raids at Chennai Port to combat the smuggling of counterfeit currency.

The raids began on Friday evening after DRI officials received a tip-off that counterfeit currency, including the new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 denomination notes, had arrived in the country. DRI officials are currently searching Chennai, Tughlakabad, Kanpur, Kolkata and Mumbai after receiving the tip-off.

All cargo is being screened at the Chennai port, with the outbound movement of containers requiring approval from the DRI. Inbound cargo has not been affected, according to Port authorities.

Officials believe that the fake currency was sent to India from either Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or Nepal. The operations will end only after all containers sent from the aforementioned countries during an unspecified time period were checked by the DRI.
