33 percent sub-quota introduced for women in railway catering units 
7-3-2017 
Railways has introduced 33% of sub-quota for women in the allotment of food stalls at rail premises as a special provision in the new catering policy.

The new catering policy was launched recently by railway minister Suresh Prabhu as promised in the Rail Budget 2016-17.

The allotment of quota for women in catering units aims to empower women economically, according to a senior IRCTC official.

IRCTC, railwaysâ€™ catering PSU, is responsible to implement the new policy.

At present, 25% of the minor catering units are reserved for various categories like SC (6%), ST (4%), BPL (3%), OBC (3%), Minorities (3%), freedom fighters (4%) and physically challenged persons (2%) at major stations.

While in other category stations, 49.5% catering units are reserved for various categories like SC (12%), ST (8%), OBC (20%) and minorities (9.5%).

The policy allows 33% sub-quota for women in allotment of each category of minor catering units at all category of stations.

Under the provision, the railways will ensure that women participation does not fall below a specific level.

The sub-quota reservation for women in each category will ensure allotment of minimum 8% stalls to women at major stations and minimum 17% at other category stations, the IRCTC official said.

There are approximately 8,000 minor catering units in Indian Railways.
