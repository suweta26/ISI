Bollywood actor Hrishita Bhatt, who was last seen in Junooniyat (2016), got hitched and announced the news on social media Tuesday night.

Newly-wed couple Hrishita and Anand Tiwari pose for the camera.

Hrishita tied the knot with Anand Tiwari, a diplomat with United Nations, in a private ceremony in Delhi on March 4.

““We kept it a low key affair with just family and friends at the celebration. Since our families wanted the wedding to be a low key affair we mutually decided to keep it private. We seek your blessings on embarking this new journey of our lives,” Hrishita said in a statement.

The actor shared pictures from the ceremony on her Instagram account:
