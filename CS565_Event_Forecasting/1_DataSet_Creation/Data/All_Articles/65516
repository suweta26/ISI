Children’s encyclopedias in US updated with President Trump edition 
14-3-2017 
Dozens of presidential encyclopedias in the United States aimed at children have now been updated with a new section on President Donald Trump.

Several of these books are now available for purchase in the US.

Scholastic’s Rookie Biographies series, which targets first and second-graders, has already introduced Trump in its latest edition.

“Meet Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a famous entrepreneur. He is also a television personality. In 2015, Trump surprised many people when he decided to run for president. In November 2016, he won the election. Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States,” reads the chapter on Trump.

Another noteworthy title out for purchase is “President Donald Trump” by author Joanne Mattern.

In a chapter on his presidential run, Mattern writes: “On June 16, 2016, Trump announced he was running for president. He was an unusual choice because he had no experience in politics... Trump ran against Hillary Clinton. She had a lot more experience in politics... The race was close, but Trump won. Many people were happy”.

While these accounts present short biographical sketches of Trump, they almost fail to capture the outrage and protests that Trump continues to face.

“Donald Trump inspired his supporters to try something new. He promised them a better future. Millions of Americans are counting on him to help improve their lives,” adds Mattern.

Other similar books for kids include “Donald Trump,” from Abdo Publishing’s series of fourth-grade-level Presidential biographies and “The New Big Book of US Presidents,” a large hardcover published by Running Press.
