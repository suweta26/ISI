Expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa on Saturday denied allegations of threatening one of the two women who had accused her husband and son of sexual harassment. Bhanumathi, a domestic help who was employed by Pushpa, had filed a police complaint last year alleging that she and her sister were sexually harassed by Pushpa’s husband T Lingesvara Thilakan and son L Pradeep Raja.

“Bhanumathi, who had gone missing, reached the DGP office and filed a complaint against me for threatening her to withdraw the sexual harassment case. This is false and fabricated. I am not involved in the episode as I am in Delhi on Parliament work,” Pushpa claimed in a complaint to the Tamil Nadu DGP.

Bhanumathi (22), a resident of Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu, had reportedly been missing since Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, on Friday, the Election Commission (EC) refused to accept the reply filed by T T V Dinakaran on behalf of V K Sasikala to a complaint challenging her appointment as AIADMK’s interim general secretary.

AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala has not been provided a separate bathroom or facilities like water heater, air-conditioner, cot and mattress in her cell, except for a television set, authorities at Bengaluru’s Central Jail had said.

Earlier, on the eve of former Tamil Nadu chief minister late J Jayalalithaa’s 69th birthday (February 24), AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan, serving a jail term in connection with a disproportionate assets case, had said that she was feeling “lonely” in the absence of her predecessor and long-time friend. In a message to party workers, Sasikala urged them to tirelessly serve the public and uphold Jayalalithaa’s fame.
