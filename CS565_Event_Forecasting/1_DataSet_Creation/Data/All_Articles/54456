4-3-2017 
THE HARYANA government has decided to expand the network of dialysis centres in the state to provide the facility to patients at an affordable price, said Health Minister Anil Vij while replying to a question raised by MLA Gian Chand Gupta during the ongoing budget session of the Assembly. Vij said while dialysis centres have initially been opened in Panchkula, Gurugram, Jind and Sirsa districts on public, private partnership (PPP) basis, such centres would also be set up in 10 more district hospitals. They are Ambala, Bhiwani, Rewari, Panipat, Sonepat, Faridabad, Hisar, Yamunanagar, Jhajjar and Bahadurgarh.

The minister also said that an attempt would be made to open the dialysis centres in all districts. The department has already signed agreements to open these centres. The patient will have to pay only Rs 959 for each dialysis against the Rs 2,000-3,000 charged in the market.

Gupta said the government should appoint a gynaecologist, radiologist and physician at Government Dispensary, Sector 16, Panchkula. Vij said there were no norms according to which specialists could be deployed at dispensaries. He further said that specialists were present at the Government Hospital in Sector 6, Panchkula. After sanction from the finance department, the existing facility would be increased from 200 beds to 300 beds.
