12-3-2017 
Senior legislator of Andhra Pradesh and three-time MP from Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Kurnool district Bhuma Nagi Reddy died of a heart attack at Nandyal, Kurnool district on Sunday. The annual budget of Andhra Pradesh will not be presented on Monday as the legislature has declared a holiday following his death.

He was 53. He is survived by two daughters and a son. His wife and former MLA Shobha Nagi Reddy died in a road accident during the election campaign in April 2014.

Popularly known as Bhuma in political circles, he shot into national headlines by contesting against former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao from Nandyal constituency in 1996 and lost the seat with a margin of 90,000 votes. After Narasimha Rao resigned his Nandyal seat, Bhuma got re-elected in by-elections by defeating former union minister MV Rangaiah Naidu with a record majority of over three lakh votes.

At around 5.30 am on Sunday, Bhuma suffered a massive stroke and he was immediately shifted to a private hospital at Allagadda. Later, he was shifted to Nandyal hospital for better treatment. He was kept on ventilator. Doctors tried their best to resuscitate him, but he breathed his last at around 12.15 pm.

An MBBS drop-out, Bhuma represented Allagadda assembly constituency twice before shifting to Nandyal assembly constituency in 2014 elections. After the death of his wife, his daughter Akhila Priya won the Allagaddda seat in subsequent elections.

This is the third time that Bhuma suffered the heart attack. In the past, he also underwent a bypass surgery for his heart ailment, party sources said.
