9-3-2017 
Hardik Pandya has been omitted from the Indian squad for the remaining two Tests against Australia. The rest of the squad remains unchanged.

Murali Vijay and KL Rahul have been picked in the squad despite injury issues for both openers. While KL Rahul is battling a sore shoulder, Vijay missed the Bangalore Test due to a shoulder injury, which resulted in Abhinav Mukund making a comeback to the Test team after close to six years.

The four-match series is level 1-1 with two more Tests to be played in Ranchi on March 16 and Dharamsala on March 25. Australia registered a win in India after 13 years when they won the Pune Test by 333 runs but India bounced back in style when they defeated Australia by 75 runs in Bangalore to draw level.

Ranchi and Dharamsala will be hosting their first-ever Test matches.
