3-3-2017 
The BJP would get two-thirds majority and storm to power in Uttar Pradesh, party chief Amit Shah said on Friday, the eve of the sixth and the second-last phase of voting in the country’s largest state.

Speaking at a press conference in Varanasi, Shah said there was a BJP wave in the state similar to the one in 2014.

The BJP had swept the Lok Sabha election that year, winning 71 of the 80 seats in the state. Its Uttar Pradesh performance was the big factor in the BJP getting a majority on its own.

At 1pm on March 11 the BJP would for the government, Shah, who was crediting with the party’s impressive showing in the state in the Lok Sabha elections, said.

The counting of votes is to be held on March 11, three days after the last round of polling in the state.

Targeting the ruling Samajwadi Party, the BJP chief said corruption and unemployment was rampant.

The law and order situation was so bad that the chief minister was hoping that a rape accused minister would give himself up, Shah said of Gayatri Prasad Prajapati.

Prajapati, accused of gang rape, is on the run.

People were tired of both the state’s ruling Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party and had reposed faith in the BJP.

The outcome of the election had been sealed in the first five phases, he said.
