Election results: How Modi won UP in just 4 rounds, devastating Akhilesh-Rahul and Mayawati 
12-3-2017 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party smashed rivals, the Samajwadi Party-Congress combine of Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, and Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party, to register a spectacular win in Uttar Pradesh assembly election 2017.

The seven-round political slugfest in India’s most populous state saw the BJP score a knockout, much like its stellar showing in UP in the 2014 general elections, when it won a landslide 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.

Here is a ringside view of how Modi’s ferocious poll assault played out across seven rounds this year, flooring the opposition and getting the BJP 312 seats out of 403 (a resounding 77.41% success).

Round 1

The ring for the opening round was the volatile western UP and the BJP got off to a blistering start for the 73 seats on offer across 15 districts. The party had won only 11 of these seats in the 2012 state polls. The scorecard changed this time to a stunning 66 seats. The SP and BSP reeled under the onslaught, managing only 3 seats each. The BJP had caught them cold in a region where communal polarisation, caste considerations, demonetisation, and farm debt were seen as the key talking points during the build-up.

Round 1: 73 seats 1. BJP — 66

2. SP — 3

3. BSP — 3

4. Congress - 0

Round 2

Results reveal the BJP was on a roll. Voters across Rohilkhand and parts of western UP scored this round 50 out of 67 seats for the BJP. The party had won only 10 of these seats in 2012. Mayawati stumbled badly in this round, failing to win a single seat. The BSP had won 18 of these seats in 2012. Akhilesh managed to sneak in a few blows, but it wasn’t enough. The SP won 15 seats, down from 34 in 2012. The BJP’s overall scorecard swelled to 116 seats.

Round 2, 67 seats 1. BJP — 50

2. SP — 15

3. Congress — 2

4. BSP — 0

Round 3

The 69 seats on offer spanned 12 districts, including urban centres Lucknow and Kanpur, as well as the Yadav family turf of Mainpuri and Etawah. Results reveal the SP and the BSP could not duck, bob or weave under the BJP’s incisive blows. The BJP pocketed a staggering 55 of the seats, up from a mere 5 in 2012. The SP had won 55 of these seats in 2012, it managed 11 this year. Incidentally, following infighting in the SP ahead of the elections, Akhilesh had changed candidates on as many as 20 seats in the region that comprises the potato belt and Kannauj’s perfume industry. Both Akhilesh and Mayawati were in deep trouble by now. Tables turned, the BJP’s overall tally soared to 171.

Round 3, 69 seats 1. BJP — 55

2. SP — 11

3. BSP — 2

4. Congress — 1

Round 4

The arena moved to areas that included the BSP’s perceived stronghold Bundelkhand and the Congress pocket borough of Rae Bareli. Mayawati would have pinned hopes on this round, but it was not to be. Results reveal Modi had rivals on the ropes again, scoring at will. The BJP won 40 of the 53 seats in this round, up from 5 in 2012. The SP went down from 24 seats in 2012 to a mere 2. The BSP’s returns were a poor 2 seats, a slide from the 15 in 2012.

At this point, results reveal UP voters made it a no contest and Modi and the BJP were home with three rounds of voting to spare. The BJP’s overall tally after round 4 rose to 211 seats. The party had breezed past the 202 halfway mark on its own in the 403-member House. The SP and BSP were bruised and battered by now, but in the tradition of Indian electoral democracy, they did not know it yet.

Round 4, 53 seats 1. BJP — 40

2. SP — 2

3. BSP — 2

4. Congress — 3

Round 5

The bout moved to eastern UP and results show the BJP landed punch combinations with Muhammad Ali-esque chutzpah and Mike Tyson-esque ferocity. Neither Akhilesh nor Mayawati could counterpunch. The BJP won a massive 44 of the 52 seats in this round, up from 5 in 2012. The BJP’s overall scorecard soared to 255 seats and it was on course for the biggest victory by any party in UP since Indira Gandhi led the Congress to 309 seats in 1980 before the state was divided.

Round 5, 52 seats 1. BJP — 44

2. SP — 3

3. BSP — 4

4. Congress — 0

Round 6

The UP voter continued embracing saffron in the penultimate round and gave the BJP 32 of the 49 seats on offer. Akhilesh and Mayawati thew some jabs, but it was too little too late. The BJP’s tally now stood at an imposing 287. Modi’s 23 public rallies and two road shows in about a month in a shrill political campaign were paying off.

Round 6, 49 seats 1. BJP — 32

2. SP — 7

3. BSP — 7

4. Congress — 1

Round 7

BJP smashed the record in the final round of voting, winning 25 of the 40 seats on offer. It logged up a unanimous victory with 312 seats on its own.

Round 7, 40 seats 1. BJP — 25

2. SP — 6

3. BSP — 1

4. Congress — 0
