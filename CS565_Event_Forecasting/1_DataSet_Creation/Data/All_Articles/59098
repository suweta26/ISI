Geneva Motor Show: Maruti Suzuki to launch 2 facelifts, 2 new cars next fiscal 
8-3-2017 
India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki is gearing up to introduce four new products -- two facelifts and two new cars -- in the next fiscal starting April 1.

“We had earlier announced that we would bring 15 models by 2020. We have done eight so far. As part of the plan, in the next fiscal, we will have four launches,” Maruti Suzuki India executive director (marketing and sales) RS Kalsi told PTI on the sidelines of the Geneva Motor show.

The company will launch the third generation Swift, which was unveiled in Geneva on Tuesday, in India in the spring of 2018. An upgrade of S-Cross is also due later this year.

Kalsi, however, declined to share details of the upcoming products.

The company, which has been bringing about two new products each year in the past couple of years, is accelerating the introduction with an eye to strengthen its hold in the market.

Asked about growth expectations in the new fiscal, he said the market is poised for growth and the company’s will be faster than the industry’s.

“We have been growing at a good rate in the past five years and next fiscal, we are sure of a double-digit growth,” Kalsi said.

So far in April to February, the company has sold around 13 lakh units, he added.

On whether the company is aiming to have 50% market share, up from the current 47%, he said: “For us, what is important is growing faster than the industry.”
