Tabling the Bill, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Arun Chaturvedi said that in pursuance of the directions of the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney and others vs Union of India and others, the Rajasthan State Commission for Backward Classes was constituted by the state government order in 2007.

He further said that the Rajasthan High Court had also directed the state government to appoint a permanent commission for backward classes by enacting a suitable legislation.

“In order to implement the above direction of the Rajasthan High Court and to provide statutory status to the Rajasthan State Commission for Backward Classes, the state government has decided to bring a legislation for constitution of the commission, which will work as a permanent mechanism to advise the state government for inclusion and complaints of over-inclusion or under inclusion of any category of backward classes,” Chaturvedi said.

The minister said that the state government is committed in providing reservation to special backward classes and economically backward classes.
