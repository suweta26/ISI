Prime Minister Narendra Modi was today given a grand welcome by members in the Lok Sabha as he entered the House for the first time after the assembly elections.

Soon after the Lok Sabha assembled for the day, the Prime Minister entered the House, as all members in the treasury bench stood up and greeted him by thumping of desks, forcing TDP member Kesineni Nani to stop from asking a question related to Bharat Net Project.
