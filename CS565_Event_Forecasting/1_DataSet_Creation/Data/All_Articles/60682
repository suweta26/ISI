Pathankot terror attack: Special NIA court declares JeM chief Azhar, aides POs 
9-3-2017 
A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, on Thursday, declared Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar, his brother Mufti Rauf Asghar and two key lieutenants — Shahid Latif and Kashif Jan — proclaimed offenders (POs) in the last year’s Pathankot airbase attack case.

The NIA had initiated the process before the court of additional district and sessions judge Tarsem Mangla in SAS Nagar on January 9.

The NIA had also informed the court that a red-corner notice was issued against the accused.

The central agency, after obtaining an ‘open-ended non-bailable warrant’ from a special NIA court in May last year, had forwarded a dossier to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is the nodal agency representing the Interpol in the country.

On December 19, the agency filed a challan against the four accused. As they have not been arrested yet, the NIA has declared them POs.
