The team was on patrolling duty to ensure the security of the under-construction Mirtur-Gangaloor road. As they were cordoning-off a patch near Cherli, around 450 kms from state capital Raipur, the securitymen came under heavy firing from a group of ultras, leading to a fierce gun-battle, the IG said.

However, the Naxals fled the spot soon after, he added. “CAF constable Hemant Kumar was killed in the firing while an assistant constable in the district force, Dubba Ram, received injuries,” Sundarraj said. Reinforcement was rushed to the spot, he added. Efforts were on to evacuate the injured security personnel and bring the body of Kumar out of the forest, he said, adding that further details were awaited.
