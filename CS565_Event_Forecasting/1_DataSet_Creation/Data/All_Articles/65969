Both sides were under the influence of alcohol, said the police.

The accused then broke a bottle on Sachin’s head and fled the spot.

They were later arrested and charged with murder.

In the second case, a man was shot dead with a country-made revolver in Dharavi around noon. The police had not been able to identify the deceased or the accused till late evening.

“We passed on his (the deceased’s) photograph in the locality but no one seems to know him. We have not found anything in his pockets either.

We suspect he was brought from outside and shot dead here,” said an officer.
