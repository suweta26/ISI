When a new party contests election for the first time, the election commission asks it to choose from three available election symbols. If denied that opportunity, Swaraj India candidates may have to contest on different symbols from different wards, making it similar to Independent candidates, a Swaraj India spokesperson said.

Appearing for the party, lawyer Arvind Nigam argued that the poll panel denied their request for a symbol on March 7, despite a provision in the rules to provide a symbol to a registered but unrecognised political party like Swaraj India, which is set to make its debut in MCD polls.
