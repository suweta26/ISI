Diesel hybrid vehicles could be undercutting the capital’s green fight

A recent study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows that Delhi accounts for 62% of the electric vehicles sold in the country, an indicator that its leading the transition towards non-polluting vehicles. But this could well be nullified by the fact that the capital also accounts for sales of 79% of diesel mild-hybrid vehicles. Reason: The diesel hybrids are only a “mild improvement” over polluting diesel vehicles and they enjoy the benefits given by the central govt’s FAME programme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicle) such as excise duty cuts. Time to consider a course correction.
