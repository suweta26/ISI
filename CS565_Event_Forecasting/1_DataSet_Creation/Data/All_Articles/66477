Enterprise solutions provider SAP is betting big on the growth of the SME sector in India which accounts for nearly 80% of the client base in the country, an official of the company said.

“The growth of SAP lies in the growth of the SME sector in the country”, said Krishnan Chatterjee, head (marketing), Indian sub-continent of SAP India.

He said that out of the company’s 8000-odd client base, 80% comprised SME units, where the potential for growth is manifold than of the large corporate.

With the GST regime coming in place from July one this year, SAP has come out with an enterprise solution `GST in a box’ which would help the SME sector to be ready for compliance with the new indirect taxation regime.

He said that since capital is a constraint for the SME sector, SAP had made deployability of the solution from Cloud to keep the costs affordable.

“Even large corporates which have specific software installed are now shifting to hybrid cloud”, he told reporters here today.

He said that new GST software for the SMEs had been developed in India at its development centre in the country.

SAP India has two development centres at Bangalore and Gurgaon where 10,000 engineers work.
