2-3-2017 
NEW DELHI: Indo-US cooperation in fighting terror looks set to grow under the Trump administration, with the two sides resolving to further strengthen the bilateral security training mechanism.A delegation of officials from the US met their counterparts in the home ministry on Wednesday and discussed ways to streamline the training programmes which include negotiations in hostage situations, terror crime scene investigation, besides new courses relating to cyberspace and maritime security."India and the US are working towards strengthening bilateral ties on security front. Besides, the US will be introducing two new courses for Indian police officers this year," a home ministry official said.Indian police officers currently can opt for six training courses under the anti-terrorism assistance (ATA) pact between the two countries.These courses have been an integral part of the bilateral cooperation on internal security between the two countries."India is a key strategic partner of the US in its war against terror. With terror groups like ISIS using Internet to reach out to potential recruits in India, the ATA courses are seen as extremely relevant," the official said.Currently the ATA courses include investigating the dark web (IDW), hostage negotiation training, terrorist crime scene investigation, besides others.Around 120-150 police officers from central police organisations and state police forces visit the US every year for training in these courses under the ATA and the number may go up to 200 this year with introduction of two new courses.
