Samsung has started mass producing the Galaxy S8 in its manufacturing unit in Vietnam and it set a goal to sell 10 million units, according to a report by Korea’s Naver.com. The South Korean giant is said to produce 4.7 million units of its upcoming flagship this month and a further 7.8 million units in April.

The report says a total of 12.5 million units will be manufactured for the first month of availability of the Galaxy S8. Though it’s not clear how many of those will be the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 and how many will be for the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8+. For far, these numbers have not been confirmed by Samsung, so take it with a grain of salt.
