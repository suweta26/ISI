Real estate baron Gopal Ansal will have to surrender to serve the remaining period of the one-year sentence in the Uphaar fire tragedy case with the Supreme Court Thursday dismissing his plea for parity with his elder brother Sushil Ansal.

“The appeal filed by Gopal Ansal is dismissed,” a three-judge bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi said.

Justice Gogoi, in a 2:1 majority verdict on February 9, had granted relief to 76-year-old Sushil Ansal considering age-related complications by awarding him jail term already undergone and had asked Gopal to surrender in four weeks to serve the remaining jail term.

Jethmalani told the bench that Gopal Ansal be given some time to surrender.

“Gopal Ansal will surrender to serve the rest of the sentence as imposed on him on March 20,” the bench said.
