You already know that Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt have revisited the 90’s popular song ‘Tamma Tamma’ in their upcoming release, ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’. While their fans are yet to get a peek into the remixed version, guess who had the first look at the song. It was none other than Madhuri Dixit Nene, who had featured in the original track.



According to reports, Varun and Alia were keen on showing their song to both Madhuri and Sanjay Dutt, as they are the reason why the song became such a rage in the early nineties. We hear, the duo showed the song to Madhuri on Wednesday night. Turns out, the ‘Dedh Ishqiya’ actress was impressed with their dance moves and complimented both of them for ‘Tamma Tamma Again’. Varun and Alia intend to visit Sanjay at his Bandra home soon to seek his approval.



While Varun has grown up watching Sanjay on the sets of his dad David Dhawan’s films, Alia too has an emotional connect with Sanju baba as her father Mahesh Bhatt was a mentor of sorts to him. Both the celebs are huge fans of Madhuri’s acting chops and dancing skill too.
