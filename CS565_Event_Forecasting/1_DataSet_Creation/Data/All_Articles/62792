11-3-2017 
Bhagalpur: A court in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district has issued a non-bailable warrant against ML Choudhury, former vice-chancellor of Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, for alleged irregularities in appointments during his tenure.

The special investigation team (SIT), probing the alleged irregularities in appointment of assistant professors-cum-junior scientists in BAU, had moved the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM)-10 Ashutosh Pandey on Thursday for issuance of the arrest warrant.

The former VC, who was served notice by the SIT for interrogation earlier this week, did not turn up.

Police said an FIR was lodged against Choudhury after a probe committee, headed by retired Patna high court judge justice Syed Mohammed Mahfooz Alam, constituted in 2015, had indicted him for anomalies in appointment. The panel found that many appointments during his tenure were made by ignoring the candidates’ performance in written test and academic records.
