They said governments while trying to improve the quality of life of their citizens must also maintain the security of data and privacy of citizens.

“The governments must actively encourage individuals, businesses and NGOs to come up with initiatives and interfaces that improve administration and service delivery,” it said.

Lawmakers from Pakistan’s Sindh and Punjab provinces joined Indian counterparts from Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Delhi and Gujarat during the dialogue. Former Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and another MP Dushyant Chautala were among the prominent faces in the Indian delegation.
