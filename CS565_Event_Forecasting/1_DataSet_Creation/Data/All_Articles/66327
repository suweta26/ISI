15-3-2017 
Tamil Nadu’s ruling AIADMK and the DMK on Wednesday announced their candidates for the April 12 by-election for the Radhakrishnan Nagar assembly constituency.

The seat fell vacant with the death of Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa.

The AIADMK announced it was fielding its Deputy General Secretary T.T.V. Dinakaran. The DMK said it will field M. Maruduganesh.

Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar, who has floated her forum MGR Amma Deepa Peravai, is also expected to join the contest.

Former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, leading the breakaway AIADMK group, is also expected to field its candidate.

The Panneerselvam camp has filed a petition with the Election Commission to declare as void the election of the now jailed V.K. Sasikala as the AIADMK General Secretary and the appointment of Dinakaran as the Deputy General Secretary.

Panneerselvam is also claiming the AIADMK’s “two leaves” election symbol for his faction.

The results of the by-election will be declared on April 15.
