The failure to prosecute atrocities in South Sudan is “appeasement” and makes the world complicit in the continuing bloodshed, the head of a UN human rights investigation said on Tuesday. “The challenge for accountability is that alleged perpetrators still occupy senior political and military positions,” Yasmin Sooka told the UN Human Rights Council.
