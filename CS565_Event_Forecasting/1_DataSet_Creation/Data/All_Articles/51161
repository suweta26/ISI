After Shahid Kapoor’s Udta Punjab, Swara Bhaskar-starrer Anaarkali of Aarah is the latest victim of piracy: Videos showing deleted scenes from the final cut of the movie appeared online on Tuesday.

Talking about the leaked scenes, debutant director Avinash Das said, “It is sad. I now fear the entire film might be leaked online before the release. If the censor copy of Udta Punjab could be leaked, the threat looms large for my movie as well.”

“I had no clue about this. I got to know only when you told me. Let me see what can be done,” he added.

“There are a lot of people who have their hands on the footage one has for a film. I guess one of the people decided to do this,” Das added.

The leaked video features three scenes -- one with Pankaj Tripathi, another one where Swara is seen naked from the back, and a third one which shows Sanjay Mishra molesting Swara on a stage. All these scenes were cut by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). Actors Pankaj and Sanjay play important roles in the film.

Anaarkali of Aarah is the story of a folk singer hailing from Ara district in Bihar.

The film releases on March 24.
