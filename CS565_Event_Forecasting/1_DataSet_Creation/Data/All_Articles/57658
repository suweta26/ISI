NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said that the Finance Bill 2017 would be passed in Parliament by the end of March, ANI reported.A Finance Bill, after the presentation of the Union Budget by the Finance Minister, is introduced in Lok Sabha so that all financial proposals made by the Government of India are implemented with ease.Yesterday, Jaitley appeared in Delhi high court to face a pugnacious Ram Jethmalani who cross-examined him in connection with his defamation suit against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP functionaries.Appearing for Kejriwal, Jethmalani fired a salvo of 52 questions at Jaitley in the nearly daylong proceedings in a jam-packed court, but 11 of these were "disallowed" by joint registrar Amit Kumar for either being a "matter of record and irrelevant to the case", or for being "questions of law and not fact" that could be argued later.During the cross-examination, Jethmalani tried to corner Jaitley on why he felt his reputation had been damaged in a manner that was "irreparable and unquantifiable", but the senior BJP functionary remained unruffled, calmly answering the queries.
