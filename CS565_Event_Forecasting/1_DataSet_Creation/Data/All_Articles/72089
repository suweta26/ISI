Uttar Pradesh’s new chief minister Yogi Adityanath spent 18 years in Lok Sabha as a lawmaker.

2. He also proposed that Article 1 of the Constitution be amended to replace the word ‘India’ with ‘Hindustan’.

3. In several speeches he demanded a nation-wide ban on cow slaughter, bringing in four private member’s bill on this between 1998 and 2009.
