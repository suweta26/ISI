Tamil Nadu finance minister describes Pannerselvam-led rebels ‘misled brothers’

Tamil Nadu finance minister D Jayakumar, in a veiled reference to AIADMK rebels led by O Panneerselvam, described them on Thursday as “misguided brothers” who have created “political turbulence”.

Concluding his maiden budget address in the assembly, he said late Jayalalithaa had handed over the “lamp of governance to us,” and added it was to “light up,” the lives of the poor.

In a veiled reference to the rebels, without naming either of them including Panneerselvam who was present in the House, he said, “amid the political turbulence created by some of our brothers, who have been misguided by some, that lamp has been protected.”

Quoting saint-poet Tiruvalluvar’s couplet, he said “a wise man” with a determined mind will conquer even a flood of troubles. It was their duty to keep the lamp eternal to continue the journey towards progress, he added.

The AIADMK camp led by VK Sasikala had dubbed Panneerselvam as a “betrayer,” after he had revolted against her last month.

The former chief minister has the support of 12 MLAs and 12 MPs besides a host of other party functionaries including veteran E Madusudanan.

Hailing chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as a “man of practical wisdom,” the minister said government will “march forward,” and implement all welfare schemes initiated by Jayalalithaa. He said government will also “formulate many more people friendly programmes”.

Ending his address, Jayakumar said he was always “indebted to the guiding spirit,” of Jayalalithaa.
