India is likely soon to impose an import tax of 25% on wheat, two government sources said on Wednesday, reinstating the tariff after a gap of nearly three months following big purchases from overseas in recent months.

India, the worldâ€™s second-biggest wheat producer, lowered the import tax on the grain to 10%from 25%in September 2016 and scrapped the duty on December 8 last year.
