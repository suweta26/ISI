Iris-enabled and biometric tablets will see a bigger uptake in 2017 and overall, the market will see traction towards institutional and government sales, CMR analyst Menka Kumari said. The research firm said the market is moving towards a consolidation phase and 2017 will see further shrinkage with only 6-7 serious players remaining in the list.

“We have seen about 40 players exiting the market in the past 3-4 years. Unless the tablet industry comes out as a gateway for a particular solution, the turnaround would be difficult for the market,” CMR said. While smartphones are taking care of the masses, the tablets industry should cater to particular segments and customised their specs accordingly, it added.

According to estimates by GSMA Intelligence Consumer Survey 2016 conducted across 56 countries on the mobile usage trend, India will lead the world in smartphone adoption with a net addition of 350 million connections in 2016-20. “India will lead the growth with around 350 million net smartphone additions,” GSMA Intelligence Senior Analyst Gu Zhang said.
