The move came after the Home Ministry officials got the hint that there maybe a much larger conspiracy and more people in multiple locations might have links with Saifullah, who was killed in the encounter.

The suspected ISIS terrorist was killed in a house on the outskirts of Lucknow early today after a 12-hour long operation.

Saifullah is suspected to be linked with the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain train in Madhya Pradesh yesterday, police said.

An NIA team has reached Bhopal to look into the suspected terror attack.
