Finance Minister D Jayakumar is scheduled to present the first budget of the Palaniswami government.

On February 18, the Palaniswami government had won the confidence vote in the assembly by a comfortable 122-11 margin after high drama and bedlam in the House.

The vote was preceded by eviction of principal opposition DMK and walkout by its allies, which have 98 legislators in the 234-member House, in protest.
