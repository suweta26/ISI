As soon as the proceedings began after obituary references were made on the passing away of four former members, Opposition members raised various issues, including those related to hate crimes against Indians in the US. AIADMK members wanted to raise the issue of Sri Lankan Navy firing at Tamil fishermen. They raised slogans and trooped into the Well of the House.

The members went back after Speaker Sumitra Mahajan assured that they could raise the issuer during Zero Hour.

As a mark of respect to the departed members including former Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray, the House stood in silence for a brief while. Other former members who passed away were Jambuwant Dhote, P Shiv Shanker and Syed Shahabuddin.
