Acclaimed filmmaker Aparna Sen says it is shameful that Lipstick Under My Burkha is not getting a certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in India.

Aparna’s actress-daughter Konkona Sensharma stars in Lipstick Under My Burkha, which is directed by Alankrita Shrivastava.

Lipstick Under My Burkha has been deemed too “lady oriented” in content and according to the censor board, it is laced with sexual scenes and abusive words. The film won a gender equality award at the Mumbai film fest last year, and recently won the Audience Award at the Glasgow Film Festival.
