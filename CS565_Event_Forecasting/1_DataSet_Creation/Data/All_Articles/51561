Naidu laments politics soft on terror, hard on nationalism 
1-3-2017 
Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday deplored the “opportunistic politics” in the country which is “soft” on terrorism and “hard” on nationalism, remarks that came against the backdrop of nationalism versus free speech row.

“Opportunistic politics’ agenda is to be soft on terrorists & separatists and hard on nationalists.

“Irony of today is red carpet for separatists & traitors and red line for nationalists,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister tweeted.

“Some are advocating #Azadi for Kashmir against national interest, but are woefully silent on #Azadi for Muslim women from exploitation,” the former BJP president said in a series of tweets.

Naidu’s tweets followed the unrest on the Delhi University campus over the last few days.

Hundreds of students and teachers had yesterday marched through the DU’s streets to protest the attack by members of RSS-affiliated ABVP on the Left-aligned AISA a few days ago.

A day earlier, the ABVP had taken out a ‘Tiraga Yatra’ against Left-leaning groups for inviting JNU student leader Umar Khalid to an event at Ramjas College last week which triggered violence.

The invite, however, was cancelled after ABVP activists allegedly vandalised the venue. ABVP has been insisting that inviting Khalid, who is facing a sedition case in connection with an event at JNU, was “anti-national”.

Gurmehar Kaur, a 20-year-old student of a Delhi college and daughter of an army martyr, took up cudgels against the ABVP and became the rallying point for those advocating freedom of speech.
