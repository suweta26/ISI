A laptop was stolen from a US Secret Service agent in New York and remains missing, the agency said in a statement Friday, amid reports that the device contained floor plans of Trump Tower.

CNN -- citing law enforcement sources in New York -- said that though the computer was highly encrypted, it contained Trump Tower floor plans and other sensitive contents.

US President Donald Trump resided in the luxury high-rise before moving into the White House. His wife Melania and youngest son Barron still live there.

The Secret Service did not detail the contents of the laptop, but emphasised that such devices “contain multiple layers of security including full disk encryption and are not permitted to contain classified information,” adding that an investigation is ongoing.

CNN said the laptop was taken from the agent’s car in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.

The elite agency is tasked with protecting the US president, former presidents and vice presidents, as well as foreign heads of state on official visits.
