Australia’s low-score failures in 4th innings increases after Bangalore loss 
7-3-2017 
For Australia, there seems to be a strange connection when it comes to chasing small totals in the fourth innings of a Test match. It seems that smaller the total, the harder it is for Australia to secure a victory.

In the fourth innings of the Bangalore Test against India, Australia needed 188 to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. However, Ravichandran Ashwin picked up his 25th five-wicket haul as Australia were bowled out for 112, helping India level the series with a 75-run win.
