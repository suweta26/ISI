Goa governor Mridula Sinha has invited Parrikar to form the next government in the coastal state after he submitted a letter of support from 21 legislators on Sunday.

Three MLAs from the Goa Forward Party, three from the MGP and two Independents have pledged their support to Parrikar.

The BJP, which came second by winning 13 seats in the 40-member assembly after the Congress (17 seats), managed to garner support from other parties and Independents to attain majority under Parrikar.
