As many as 117 sugar mills have paid 100 per cent of their dues. A short season and paucity of cane has come as a blessing for growers, most of whom have received payment well over the FRP. As against the total payable amount of Rs 7,979.68 crore, mills have paid Rs 8,323.84 crore. However, some of the mills have defaulted in payment.
