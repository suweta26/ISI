4-3-2017 
BHOPAL: Abu Faisal , chief of the Madhya Pradesh unit of banned terrorist organisation Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) who was one of the masterminds behind the 2013 Khandwa jailbreak, wants to call it quits, but fears he will be eliminated by his handlers in Pakistan. Sources said Faisal, who is lodged in Bhopal jail, told a cop last month that he wanted to quit SIMI and reunite with his family, but feared that he would be killed if he did so.Faisal is believed to have played a role in the Bhopal jailbreak too. Sources said he operated fearlessly from various jails where he was kept after his team helped him build a database on prison officers, their family members and details like names of the schools where their kids studied in. His team even tried to threaten some top officers using such details, sources added."It seems someone within the prison department was sharing information about the jail staff and their family members with SIMI operatives who are facing trial. Their mole in the department has to be unearthed," said an intelligence officer requesting anonymity.Faisal alias Dr Farhan had even wanted to target PM Modi. He had also hatched unsuccessful plots to bomb Sabarmati Jail and free former SIMI chief Safdar Nagori, who was given life term for sedition and terror activities by a court earlier this week. Faisal was first arrested by Indore police in 2006.
