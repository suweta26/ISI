Police said Uzonna came to India on visit VISA in September last year and had been staying in Hyderabad.

“He met with one Davis Chris Richard belonging to Kenya in a pub, who is drug peddler. Then he hatched a plan to earn money for his lavish life by supplying drugs to needy customers,” the senior police official said.

Uzonna used to procure 1 gram of cocaine for Rs 2,000 from Davis and used to sell the same for Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per 1 gram. Efforts are on to apprehend the other accused involved in this trade, Reddy added.
