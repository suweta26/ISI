Josh Hazlewood faults pacers’ ‘Aussie line’, credits India’s batting intent 
6-3-2017 
Australia’s pacers came to the fore for the first time in the series against India on Monday, but Josh Hazlewood felt they didn’t get enough for their hard work due to a less productive line they bowled on Day 3 of the second Test at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

“It’s pretty level now, but credit to the two guys, they sucked in their plans,” Hazlewood, who took three wickets to push India on to the backfoot in the afternoon session, told reporters. (SCORECARD)

“We still bowled a bit wider with the odd ball shooting through, but we will be back tomorrow,” the fast bowler added. “There is not much swing or reverse swing. Our plan was simple, we have to execute. In Australia, there is more bounce, here there is up and down movement. We bowled the Aussie line, a bit wide of the stumps.”

Cheteshwar Pujara hit an unbeaten 79 and, with Ajinkya Rahane (40 no), raised an unbroken 93-run fifth-wicket partnership, after opener KL Rahul’s 51 to lead India’s fightback for the first time in the series.

The hosts were 126 runs ahead at stumps on a pitch where a 200-run fourth wicket target can be very tricky to chase for Australia.

Hazlewood said there was no longer the kind of bounce which Aussie off-spinner Nathan Lyon exploited on the first day, capturing 8 for 50 to dismiss India for 189 in their first innings.

“On Day 1 and 2 the pitch was sharp, but it has got slower. The wicket played pretty well today,” he said. “They (Indian batsmen) showed more intent today; they scored more than three runs an over, which didn’t seem the case in the last couple of innings.”
