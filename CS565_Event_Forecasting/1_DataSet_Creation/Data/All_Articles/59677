“As the exam dates are nearing, we talked to the Union ministers about the hardship Tamil Nadu students would undergo because of the NEET,” K P Anbalagan to reporters here.

“A bill to exclude Tamil Nadu from the NEET has already been passed by the state assembly. We requested the Union ministers to expedite the process of getting the President’s assent for the legislation,” he said.

The delegation also demanded that an AIIMS be constructed in the state. “The minister has responded positively and it is likely that Tamil Nadu would get AIIMS,” said C Vijaya Baskar.
