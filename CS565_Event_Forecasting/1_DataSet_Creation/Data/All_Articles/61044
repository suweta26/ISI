A power cut at a government hospital in Puducherry killed three patients with kidney ailments on Thursday as their dialysis machines stopped midway through the process.

A health department official said a 75-year-old man and two women, both 55, died during the outage that lasted about seven minutes.

The hospital has generator back-up but the dialysis machines did not restart after power supply was restored.

That proved fatal, the official said, informing that the government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.

The hospital provides free dialysis to poor patients. The government announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the three people.
