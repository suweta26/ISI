WCD dept seeks CBI probe into duping in name of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ plan

The women and child development ministry has sought a CBI probe into complaints that over two lakh people in five states were allegedly duped in the name of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, one of the PM’s pet programme to address the dipping child sex ratio and empowering the girl child.

A senior ministry official said the matter came to light recently after the ministry received over 2 lakh “fake” forms, filled by people across five states – Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Bihar.

“These applicants had sought cash benefit from the ministry under the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme,” the official said.

The ministry immediately raised an alarm as under the scheme there is no provision for cash benefit.

“It is clear that certain individuals are distributing illegal forms in the name of cash incentive under the scheme. The applicants were made to pay for these forms, disclose personal details and were misled into believing they could claim a monetary benefit,” an official statement released by the ministry said.

“We have asked the CBI to probe the matter,” said a ministry official.
