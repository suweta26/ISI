The budget session of Parliament resumes on Thursday even as the political class waits with bated breath for the outcome of the five assembly elections.

The session will continue till April 12.

While the result of the Uttar Pradesh poll is likely to impact the fate of the session, Opposition parties are trying to leverage the recent civic body polls in Maharashtra and Odisha and the developments in Tamil Nadu to stitch together a larger unity against the BJP.

Home minister Rajnath Singh is likely to make a statement on the detection of an alleged ISIS module in UP, a claim refuted by the state police.
