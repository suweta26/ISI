Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan is clearly “Mahanayak” of the century. He floors fans with his performance onscreen and guides thousands towards a better lifestyle at the same time. While he has often championed the cause of the girl child and her importance, Amitabh went a step ahead Wednesday night.

Amitabh seems to have kickstarted the celebrations for Women’s Day, which is celebrated on March 8.

Big B took to Twitter and shared a picture where he is holding a placard that declares that all his assets shall be divided equally between his daughter and son after his death.
