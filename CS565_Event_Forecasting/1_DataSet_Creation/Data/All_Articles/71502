9:00 hrs IST: It’s advantage India at the start of the day as they took a healthy 152 run lead in the first innings and was also able to pick up two crucial wickets before stumps on Day 4.

8:55 hrs IST: Welcome to the final day of this thrilling encounter between India and Australia!

Cheteshwar Pujara was the star on day 4 as he smashed his third double century in his career. He broke several records, including playing the longest innings by an Indian batsman in terms of balls faced. His 202 consumed 525 balls, beating the previous mark of 495 set by Rahul Dravid in 2004 in Rawalpindi. Pujara also became the third Indian player after VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar to smash two double centuries against Australia.

Giving Pujara company was Wriddhiman Saha and the Indian wicketkeeper slammed his third century and he was invovled in a 199-run stand for the seventh wicket, the best for this wicket in India vs Australia Tests. Ravindra Jadeja extended the advantage by slamming a 55-ball 54 and he made it India’s day by picking up two wickets. With Australia still trailing by 129 runs and with only eight wickets remaining, Steve Smith’s team face an uphill task as they look to save the Test on a deteriorating wicket.

“I have the experience of scoring big runs in domestic cricket. The experience matters a lot,” said Pujara after the close of day 4. His big knock and partnership with Saha has gone a long way in ensuring India take an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the four-match series.
