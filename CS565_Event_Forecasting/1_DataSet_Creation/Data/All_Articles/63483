BJP revokes expulsion of Dayashankar Singh, removed for remark against Mayawati 
12-3-2017 
The BJP revoked on Sunday the expulsion of Uttar Pradesh leader Dayashankar Singh, who was thrown out of the party last year over his controversial remarks on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati.

The saffron party’s move came a day after it won a landslide victory in India’s most-populous state, securing the largest mandate in almost four decades.

The 44-year-old Singh, was the party vice-president when he was expelled in July for linking Mayawati to a prostitute, triggering outrage. The party’s move was seen as placating the Dalit vote, a key constituent in Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, Dayashankar’s wife Swati Singh won her assembly election from Sarojini Nagar.
