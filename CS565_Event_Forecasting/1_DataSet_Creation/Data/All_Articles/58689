Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into an attack on an All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) office at Silapathar. The office was attacked on Monday when a procession of Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Samannay Samiti, which is fighting for citizenship for Hindu Bengali refugees, was passing by. The attackers raised provocative slogans before the attack for which nine people have been arrested.
