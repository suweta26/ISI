In two separate incidents, two minors were sexually assaulted in different areas of the capital within 24 hours. In the first incident, a six-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by a man in southeast Delhi’s Govindpuri area.

The girl was found outside her home after three- four hours, looking “scared”, said police. She narrated her ordeal to her mother, who approached police. She was sent to AIIMS for treatment and a medical examination confirmed sexual assault.

She was rushed to a government hospital where doctors confirmed rape. Police said they have detained a youth.
