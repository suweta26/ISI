The Reserve Bank of India on Friday launched a mobile application (app) version of its website www.rbi.org.in.

The app will be available on Android as well as iOS platforms and can be downloaded from the Play Store/App Store in one’s Android phone or iPhone.

To start with, the most accessed sections of the website : press releases, IFSC/ MICR codes, Bank Holidays and Current Rates including Policy rates and reference rate of four major currencies have been made available on the app.

There is a dynamic window on the top of the landing page of the app which alternately displays three public awareness messages—the new design currency notes of ₹ 2000 and ₹ 500 denominations as well as RBI’s message on KYC under the “RBI Kehta Hai” series.

On clicking on any of these, the user can open and read the full text of the public awareness message issued. The user can also activate the feature of ‘push’ notification to get an alert on new releases.

RBI has invited public comments and feedback on making the app more useful and interesting.
