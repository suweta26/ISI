After the video was posted online, an investigation had been launched against Mathew. He had been missing from his artillery unit since February 25. A police source told TOI, “It is being probed if Mathew, who was attached for ‘buddy duties’ with a Colonel rank officer posted as an additional officer at the Artillery Centre in Deolali, had felt tortured or harassed after appearing in the video.” The source also said that Mathew was being questioned by various officials after the video went viral online.

In January, Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh uploaded a video where he complained against the ‘sahayak’ system, saying the officers’ wives make the jawans go to beauty parlours and do household chores. He also alleged that they sometimes have to polish the shoes of officers. However, army chief Bipin Rawat had defended the system, saying the camaraderie between ‘sahayaks’ and officers is important.
