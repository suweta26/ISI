Three RSS activists were injured in an attack allegedly by CPI(M) workers at a village near Koyilandy in the district, police said on Sunday.

The victims, all in their early 20’s, suffered injuries in their hands and legs in the attack on Saturday night at Keezhaiyur village and have been admitted to the Medical College Hospital in Kozhikode.

No one has been arrested in connection with the attack, they said.

Kerala has been a hotbed of political clashes between cadres of BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M), especially in the northern Kannur district.

Both parties have blamed each other for the cycle of violence, which has claimed several lives on both sides.

The RSS office in Kerala was attacked hours after a leader announced a reward of Rs 1 crore for anyone who brought the head of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. RSS sacked Kundan Chandrawat from all organisational posts after his remarks caused an uproar.

In February, an RSS leader was attacked and injured allegedly by CPI-M activists in Kannur district. A saffron activist was hacked to death a month before by an alleged CPI(M) worker in north Kerala’s Kannur.
