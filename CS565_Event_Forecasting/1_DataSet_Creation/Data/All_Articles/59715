He informed the Assam Assembly that the government will try to build a consensus after taking opinion from all important organisations of the state.

Sarma also said there are other issues in implementation of the Cabinet decision like lack of Sanskrit teachers and the government will not appoint anyone from outside the state.

“The Cabinet took the decision to make Computer Education and Sanskrit compulsory. Unfortunately, Computer was not highlighted and everyone focussed on Sanskrit,” he added.

On February 28, the Assam Cabinet took the decision to make Sanskrit a compulsory subject in all schools under the state board till Class VIII.

This led to strong protests from a number of social organisations, intellectuals and political parties.
