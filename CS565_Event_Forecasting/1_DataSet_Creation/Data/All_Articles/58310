7-3-2017 
Expressing concern over continued racial attacks on Indians abroad, the Congress on Tuesday hit out at the NDA government for its “silence” on the issue.

“People of Indian origin and Indian citizens are dying and are being threatened and are being told to go back from different countries but government of the day is absolutely silent,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.

He said four different incidents have happened in the last 15 days in America, with one Indian shot dead.

Training his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress leader wondered why he was silent on NRIs even when he has been “using” them for votes.

“Modi Ji, it is time for you to come out of election mode and start the process of governance, since 34 months have already passed.

“It is your solemn duty, it is your cardinal duty, it is your first duty to protect the honour, the safety and the persons of Indian origin as also Indian citizens across the world,” he said.

Surjewala said these are not isolated incidents and reminded that it started in Australia and then in New Zealand where an Indian origin person was asked to leave the country.

“Modi Ji who never tires of using NRIs for vote getting exercises and for reflecting his connects to the non-resident Indians and people of Indian origin, is completely mum on the issue,” he said.

In the latest attack, Deep Rai, a US Sikh national of Indian origin and was shot outside his home in Kent, Washington on Friday by a masked gunman who shouted “go back to your own country”.

Techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Gujarati businessman Harnish Patel were killed in attacks in the US last week.
