The Indian telecom sector manpower is set to more than double in the next five years, creating additional requirement of 4.78 million skilled workers by 2021-22, Parliament was informed today.

Further, as per analysis of Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC), 20-25 per cent of people in a telecom set up are high-skill workers that is engineers, MBAs, CAs, HR experts who require no specific skill training and are given 2-4 weeks orientation course on the job by the employer.
