“The hike in the price of LPG since October last has touched 58 per cent, causing severe hardship to the common people,” the statement said. MPYCC also flayed the Modi government for increasing the rates of indirect taxes, train fares and enhancing oil prices which caused consternation among the general public.

NDA has lost the “moral right” to continue in power as it has been “literally looting the people in order to hide the adverse effects of the demonetisation,” it added.
