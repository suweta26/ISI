Pak shuts border with Afghanistan after allowing 35,000 to cross in two days 
9-3-2017 
Pakistan has again closed the two main border crossings with Afghanistan after a temporary, two-day opening that enabled nearly 35,000 people to cross the border, officials said.

The crossings were initially closed after a string of militant attacks in Pakistan last month killed over 125 people.

Islamabad has accused Kabul of failing to take action against Pakistani militant sanctuaries in Afghanistanâ€™s border regions. Kabul has denied the allegation.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have long accused each other of failing to combat extremists who operate along the porous frontier between the two nations.
