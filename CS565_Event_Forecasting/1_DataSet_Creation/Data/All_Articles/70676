19-3-2017 
Cheteshwar Pujara played the perfect sheet anchor role for India on Day 3 of the Ranchi Test against Australia on Saturday. Showing amazing application, Pujara scored his 11th Test century to keep the Aussies at bay. Pujara’s hundred could not have come at a better time. The failure of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane mounted additional pressure on Pujara. Can the Saurashtra batsman carry on the good work with Wriddhiman Saha today?

8:59 hrs IST: Cheteshwar Pujara (130*) will be looking to play a big innings today as a good lead will be extremely crucial in this encounter.

8:55 hrs IST: Welcome to Day 4 of the third Test match between India and Australia in Ranchi!

The Ranchi Test is interestingly poised after a hard day’s play on Saturday. Pujara’s innings ensured that the hosts were willing to fight it out after Australia put 451 runs on the board after winning the toss.

Pujara was batting on 130 at stumps, the first century by an Indian batsman in the four-Test series, having spent nearly seven hours at the crease to consolidate his team’s position in the contest. Wriddhiman Saha was giving him company on 18 with India still 91 runs behind.

“We’re still ahead of the game but they are getting closer every over... we’ll be coming out pretty strong tomorrow,” said Australia’s bowling coach David Saker after Day 3’s play. That sums up the mood of this Test match, played without a major controversy so far.
