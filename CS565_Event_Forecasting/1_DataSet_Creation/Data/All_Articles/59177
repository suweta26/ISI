Police in Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday they shot dead a member of the Islamic State group in the capital, the latest suspected jihadist to be killed by security forces.

Officers were called at 6 pm (1500 GMT) on Tuesday to an apartment in Riyadh’s Al-Rayan district, where the suspect was “flaunting his support” for the extremist group, the interior ministry said in a statement.

“He started to resist and waved a gun which he was carrying,” forcing police to eliminate “the threat he posed”, the ministry said.

Another suspect was arrested.
