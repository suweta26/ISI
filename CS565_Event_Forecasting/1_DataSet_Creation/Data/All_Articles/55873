It was also learnt that the official, who was from the billing section was seen on the CCTV footages, involved in a spat with Roy’s family during payments of the hospital charges.

“We wanted to assume whether there was any medical negligence on the part of the doctors. And also as the family’s allegations that they were unnecessarily delayed by the authorities when they tried to settle the bill. We have got CCTV footages of the billing area and we are trying to get answers of some questions,” a senior officer of the investigating team said.

Probe team officers from Phoolbagan Police Station had already spoken to Roy’s wife Ruby and other family members.
