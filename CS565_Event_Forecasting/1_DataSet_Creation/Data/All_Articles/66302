Shashank Manohar has resigned as ICC Chairman with immediate effect and leaves vacant the top position in world cricket. Manohar has stepped down from his post due to ‘personal reasons’ after just eight months in charge. He had been elected unopposed for the job in May 2016 and became the first independent Chairman of the game’s governing body. He had then signed a two year term that began with immediate effect after stepping down as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

Manohar has led the effort to decentralise the power and monopoly held by ‘The Big Three’ in Cricket Australia (CA), England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and BCCI. The imbalance in power and finances created in 2014 was temporarily undone in February when a new constitution was passed in principle that tried to restore parity. However, the final decision in that regard will be taken in April – during which Manohar won’t be heading the discussions.

During the election process, Manohar was the sole nominee for the position and the ICC board unanimously supported his appointment thus making him a successful candidate.

Shashank is a prominent Indian lawyer who served first served as BCCI President from 2008-2011. Following the passing of Jagmohan Dalmiya, Shashank was re-elected as the BCCI President in October 2015 and, by virtue of that position, has held the role of ICC Chairman since then, said the ICC release at the time of his appointment.
