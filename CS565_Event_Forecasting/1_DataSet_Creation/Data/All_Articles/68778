Here are 6 points on Sinha, a low-profile but hard-working minister in the Modi government:

4) Sinha is a Bhumihar (an upper caste) by birth. He deliberately maintains a low-profile image, wears his trademark dhoti and long kurta.

5) Sinha is a three-time BJP MP in Lok Sabha. He represents Ghazipur in the Lower House.

6) As the junior minister for railways, Sinha handled key assignments including the task to connect several cities in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
