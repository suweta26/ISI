Author John le Carre’s new novel to bring back George Smiley 
7-3-2017 
Welcome back, George Smiley.

After a hiatus of more than 25 years, John le Carre is again writing about one of the world’s most famous fictional spies.

Viking told The Associated Press on Tuesday that le Carre’s A Legacy of Spies will come out on September 6. According to the publisher, the novel tells of how Smiley and such peers as Peter Guillam receive new scrutiny about their Cold War years with British intelligence and face a younger generation that knows little about their history.

The novel will also refer to the le Carre classics The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Le Carre, 85, last wrote about Smiley in the 1991 novel The Secret Pilgrim.
