A private school in Hyderabad allegedly confined 19 students, including 5-year-old kids, in a room on its premises for over one hour after their parents failed to pay school fees on time, police said on Sunday.

The incident took place on Saturday. The school management also tried to prevent the students from appearing for their annual exam, Hayathnagar Police Station inspector J Narender Goud said.

Those confined include students from Class I, said the police official.

“They (school management) confined the students and were not allowing them to write the exams saying that their parents had delayed fee payment. After police intervened, the students were released and allowed to appear for exams,” the inspector said.

A parent of one of the student lodged a complaint with police against the school management after which a case under IPC section 342 (wrongful confinement) and relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act was registered, the police officer said.
