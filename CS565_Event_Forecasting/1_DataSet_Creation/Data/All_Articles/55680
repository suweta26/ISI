The jallikattu was held in connection with a local temple festival. The event is being held in several parts of the state after the Tamil Nadu Assembly on January 23 unanimously passed an amendment bill, clearing the path for conducting it without any hindrance.

Normally, Jallikattu is held as part of the Pongal festivities in Tamil Nadu. However, it was not held during Pongal this year due to a Supreme Court ban.
