Gov. Vasip Sahin said the helicopter crashed in Istanbul’s Buyukcekmece district after taking off from Itsanbul’s Ataturk Airport, adding that the cause of the crash is under investigation. Eyewitness Fikret Karatekin, a taxi driver, told CNN-Turk television by telephone that the helicopter slammed into the tower before crashing on the highway.

“It hit the tower and crashed by spinning,” he said, adding that the highway had been closed down. The helicopter broke into piece that were scattered on the highway as well as a green area on the side of the road. Video footage from the site showed thick black smoke rising from the highway.
