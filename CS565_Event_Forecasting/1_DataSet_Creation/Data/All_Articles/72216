20-3-2017 
FBI Director James Comey confirmed for the first time Monday that the agency is investigating Russian interference in last year’s presidential election and notably Moscow’s possible collusion with President Donald Trump’s campaign.

The FBI “is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” Comey told a hearing by the House Intelligence Committee.

“And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts,” he said.
