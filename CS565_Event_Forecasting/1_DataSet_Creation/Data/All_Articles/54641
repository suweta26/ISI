The overnight anti-militancy operation in south Kashmir’s Shopian district was called off on Saturday as the militants managed to escape from the security forces’ cordon. Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Chillipora village of the district on Friday night following information about the presence of militants there, a police official said.

He said a gunfight broke out between the two sides as the security forces were closing on the militants’ positions. The exchange of fire between the two sides ended late Friday night but the security forces did not lift the cordon with the aim of stopping the militants from fleeing. “House to house searches were launched at day break on Saturday but no arrests were made. The militants had apparently managed to escape last night itself,” the official said. There were no casualties reported in the encounter.
