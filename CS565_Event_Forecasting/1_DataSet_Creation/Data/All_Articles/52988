Janata on JP’s ailment

Willy Brandt, the former West German chancellor, was refused permission by the government of India to visit Jayaprakash Narayan when the latter was ill and under detention. The Socialist International had made an unofficial request for this visit “on humanitarian grounds’’ by a delegation led by Brandt. The request was turned down, according to Surendra Mohan, Janata Party general secretary. Mohan told newsmen that there should be an impartial judicial inquiry into the circumstances under which JP had become permanently disabled. Dr Karan Singh, Union health minister, and V.B. Raju, the Congress general secretary, should apologise to the nation and join in demanding this inquiry, he said. Mohan referred to the accusations made by Singh and Raju about the opposition exploiting the illness of JP for political ends.
