Hospital officials were allegedly questioned to see if they knew of the day-to-day treatment and billing process, and if they did, why no action was taken despite complaints. Sources said Basu was on holiday during Sanjoy Roy’s treatment. During Basu’s questioning, police grilled her knowledge of the incident and the billing process among other things. Sources said the questioning was conducted to understand the rationale behind the billing process, adding those quizzed were not able to clearly define the hospital’s rates for tests and procedures.

When asked about the possibility of arrests being made, a police officer on condition of anonymity said: “We have questioned them, if we find discrepancies in their statements, we may arrest anyone in due course of investigation.” Former Apollo Gleneagles CEO Rupali Basu had resigned from her post on March 2 amid controversy over this case.
