Suicide bomber targets Bangladesh security forces camp, 2 injured 
17-3-2017 
A man blew himself up on Friday at a camp for Bangladesh’s elite security forces, wounding two others, in an apparent botched suicide attack.

The incident came a day after a series of raids on suspected militant hideouts in the country which has suffered a series of Islamist attacks in recent years.

Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said a man carrying explosives entered the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) camp near the Dhaka international airport on Friday morning. The explosives went off after he was challenged by two RAB men, wounding them both but causing no other casualties.

The camp, which hosts a mix of elite police, army and air force personnel, has since been cordoned off.

RAB spokesman Mufti Mahmud Khan told reporters the bomb exploded after the man was confronted by RAB men, although it was not clear whether the detonation was deliberate.

The spokesman said the man’s identity was not known, but that the attack was similar in style to that of previous ones by Islamist extremists.

Bangladeshi security forces launched a nationwide crackdown on Islamist extremists following a deadly siege at a cafe in Dhaka last year, arresting scores.

The drive was led by the RAB, which is tasked with tackling militancy and serious crimes in Bangladesh.

Four alleged militants were killed on Thursday when a raid on a building in the southern port city of Chittagong sparked a 15-hour stand-off with militants armed with guns and grenades.

Police said they were all members of the extremist group Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and that at least two were killed by a suicide explosion that they set off.
