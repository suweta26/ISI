A Delhi court today said it will decide on March 27 whether nine JNU students can be asked by Delhi Police to give their consent for lie detector test in a case relating to the varsity’s missing student Najeeb Ahmed.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sumit Dass, who was scheduled to pass the order today, deferred the matter saying that the order was not ready.

The court had on March 15 reserved its order after the counsel appearing for the students submitted that the “lie detector test is unconstitutional and illegal unless it is voluntary”.

The nine students, who are suspects in the case, have approached the court challenging the notice sent to them by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police seeking their presence before the magistrate for recording of their statement that whether they were willing to undergo the lie detector test.

In its notice issued on January 23, the probe agency had claimed that their lie detector test was required to get information about Najeeb’s whereabouts.

The notice was sent after the Delhi High Court had asked the police to explore other avenues of probe, like a polygraph test of persons connected to Najeeb, as all other leads had not yielded any result.

27-year-old Najeeb has been missing since October 14-15 last year after a scuffle at his JNU hostel allegedly with ABVP activists the previous night.

The RSS students’ wing has denied any involvement in his disappearance.
