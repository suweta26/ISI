In India, women earned 25% less than men in 2016

The average gender pay gap in India stands at 25%, according to Monster Salary Index (MSI) data from 2016. Men earned a median gross hourly salary of Rs 346, while women earned only Rs 260 in 2016. The good news though is that the gap has narrowed by two percentage points, over last year.
