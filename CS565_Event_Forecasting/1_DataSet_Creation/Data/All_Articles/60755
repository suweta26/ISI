The Madras High Court on Thursday refused to set aside the conviction of a 27-year-old government school teacher for sexually exploiting a girl student in Ariyalur district, while describing him as an “evil being.”

The division bench of justices S Nagamuthu and N Authinathan, however, reduced the 20-year rigorous jail term awarded to convict Madhvan by the trial court to 14 years, taking into account his poor socio-economic background.

Reducing the jail term given to Madhvan by fast-track Mahila Court in Ariyalur, the bench said, “A teacher is a role model to every student… shockingly in this case, a shameless teacher is alleged to have sexually exploited a 14-year-old child, who was his student. He is not God-like, but an evil being.”
