Jagan supporters launch online drive for prosecution of CM Chandrababu 
11-3-2017 
The admission of a petition by Supreme Court last Monday against Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in connection with the cash-for-votes case of 2015 has come as a morale booster for the YSR Congress party.

Its president YS Jaganmohan Reddy faces trial in the special CBI court in a disproportionate assets case.

YSR Congress supporters are launching a campaign on social media and filing online petitions, demanding that Naidu be prosecuted. In the past three days, more than 10,000 petitions were mobilised by Jagan’s supporters through online forum change.org to be submitted to the Chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar and other judges of the Supreme Court.

They point out that the Telangana ACB had made several references to Naidu in their charge sheet , which clearly showed his involvement in the case.

“It has become a norm of our society, where the rich and powerful are easily able to escape the law. We pray the court to order an impartial investigation into this case and bring the culprits to face the law of land,” the petitions said.

The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to Naidu on a special leave petition filed by YSR Congress party MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy and asked the former to file a counter. Reddy sought the court’s direction for registration of a case against Naidu under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The TDP supremo told media in Vijayawada that he had received notices in as many as 26 cases filed by his opponents in the past, but they could not prove any charges. “There is no merit in the case,” he said.

However, YSR Congress official spokesman Ambati Rambabu said, “He should resign from the chief minister post on moral grounds, since the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of the case and issued him notice in the cash-for-vote case.”
