Agra journalist wants FIR against Sanjay Dutt, moves court 
7-3-2017 
A video journalist on Tuesday requested an Agra court to direct police to register an FIR against actor Sanjay Dutt and three others for allegedly assaulting him. The court has asked police for a report on March 29.

Ajay Yadav told the court that on March 2 the actor, director Omung Kumar and two others assaulted him when he asked the film crew, which was shooting for the film Bhoomi, if they had the permission to block a public road.

The four not only beat him up but also attacked those who came to his assistance, Yadav said in his application to special judge Santosh Rai.

His camera, laptop, microphone and even identity card were snatched but the personnel at the Tajganj police station didnâ€™t register an FIR, Yadav said.

Dutt, who is in Agra shooting for his comeback film, held a press conference the next day and said he was not on the spot though the 57-year-old apologised for the incident.

The actor was released from a Pune jail in February 2016 after serving three years in a terror case.

Bhoomi is expected to hit the big screen on August 4.
