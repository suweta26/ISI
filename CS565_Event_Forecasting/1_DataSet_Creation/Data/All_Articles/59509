This is not the first time Kejriwal has done so, last month he lashed out at PM Modi over a video by LSR College student Gurmehar Kaur. She was given rape threats after she posted a message on social media following the Ramjas College ruckus. Kejriwal also retweeted Gurmehar Kaur on Women’s Day.

We didn’t wait for heroes. We became the hero.
