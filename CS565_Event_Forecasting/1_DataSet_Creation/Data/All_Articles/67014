Boxing Federation of India to debar boxers participating in non-sanctioned events 
15-3-2017 
The Boxing Federation of India (BFI), the governing body for the sport in the country, is considering taking action against those competing in non-sanctioned tournaments in future.

BFI secretary-general Jay Kowli said that there was a possibility of boxers facing sanctions if they participated in tournaments not under the BFI banner.

“Certainly there will be some kind of restriction if they compete in events not sanctioned by the BFI. We are working on the issue and will announce (it) soon,” he said.

The BFI also hinted that such boxers could be debarred from representing the country. “We are a new federation and working on various issues. We will announce our policy soon,” he said.

On Wednesday, Royal Sports Promotions announced the dates for the Pro Boxing India Championship this year. But the BFI distanced itself from the event saying, “They have nothing to do with the tournament”.

The organisers in a press release said that top national and international players will compete for eight teams in the month-long tournament.

Recently, the BFI had also announced that it would organise a franchise-based league at the end of the year. The league, according to BFI, will “benefit players in terms of finance and exposure”.

After Olympic Games bronze-medallist Vijender Singh turned pro in 2015, he has generated a lot of interest for boxing in the country, with several top pugilists, including Asian Games medallist L Sarita Devi and Pinki Jangra, too turning pro.
