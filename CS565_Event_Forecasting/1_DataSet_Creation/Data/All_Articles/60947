The state government would put its demand in front of the Union Home Ministry for convening a tripartite meeting involving the Centre, the state and representatives of the six communities.

“I will personally convince the Union Home Ministry for holding a tripartite meeting and solve the issue,” he said.

The state government was taking initiatives for preservation of customs, traditions, language and literature of different ethnic communities in the state, an official release quoting Sonowal, said.

The state government was all set to launch a flagship programme for this purpose and the Chief Minister sought cooperation from all ethnic communities in this regard, the release added.
