Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday expressed deep anguish and grief over the killing of a boy during an encounter between militants and security forces in Kashmir’s Pulwama district.

Extending her sympathies to the bereaved family of 15- year-old Amir Nazir, Mehbooba said it was highly unfortunate that the youth are caught in the vicious cycle of violence in the state which has consumed so many precious lives and left behind a trail of death and destruction.
