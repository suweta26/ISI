Good for Tiger Shroff that RGV doesn’t like him: Sonam Kapoor 
9-3-2017 
A day after he tweeted a weird message on International Women’s Day and targeted Tiger Shroff for his “Urmilaic pose”, Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor has slammed filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma.

RGV suggested Bollywood actor Tiger Shroff should take lessons of “machoism” from his dad, Jackie and pose more like a man. Comparing Tiger’s picture for the cover of a magazine with Urmila Matondkar’s pose, RGV wrote, “Truly real men like Bruce Lee and bindasbhidu never pose in a Urmliaish way. Please learn machosim from bindasbhidu who even without martial arts poses more like a man and never like this.”

In response, Sonam told DNA, “They should be happy that Ramu doesn’t like Tiger. Whoever Ramu doesn’t like, does very well. I am very happy.”

“I like Tiger. He’s very cool and least bothered. He is very well-behaved and performs so beautifully. I saw him performing recently at an awards event and he did such a good job. It was a pleasure to watch. I just haven’t had the chance to watch his performance, except for his first film, but whatever I see him at events and parties, I find the way he conducts himself very dignified,”she further told the tabloid.

For a change, RGV had even clarified and almost apologised for his tweets! He later tweeted the clarification, “Hey @bindasbhidu all my tweets on @iTIGERSHROFF are purely as ur fan and not otherwise ..please tell this to @AyeshaShroff and him.”
