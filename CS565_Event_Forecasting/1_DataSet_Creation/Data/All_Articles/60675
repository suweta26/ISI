“Twelve Bangladeshis comprising eight Griha Rakshi Bahini personnel (equivalent of Indian Home Guards), two government employees and two civilians illegally crossed the India-Bangladesh border and tried to rob Indian villagers on Wednesday night,” said South Tripura district’s superintendent of police Tapan Debbarma.

“When the villagers jointly hit back, the trespassers fled. However, a personnel of Griha Rakshi Bahini, identified as Nausad Mia, 62, died on the spot while another was injured in the retaliatory attack. The injured was later shifted to the government hospital by the police,” he added.

The incident occurred at Siddhinagar village under the jurisdiction of Puran Rajbari police station in southern Tripura along the Bangladesh border.

Around 12 Muslim families comprising 80 people have been residing in the village outside the border fencing.

The police officer said the Bangladeshis came into Indian territory in two auto-rickshaws and fled on the vehicles when the villagers chased them.

Border Security Force (BSF) and police officers, along with reinforcements, have been camping in the tension ridden areas, 135 km south of here.

Tripura shares an 856 km border with Bangladesh a portion of which is still unfenced.
