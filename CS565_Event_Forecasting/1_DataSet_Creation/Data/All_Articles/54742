Pollution turning India’s rainfall acidic

According to recent research by India Meteorological Department and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, pollution is causing ‘life-giving’ rain to turn increasingly acidic in many parts of the country.Analysis of rainwater samples from various places in the country shows a fall in pH levels over a decade. This is worrying as acid rain hurts the productivity of soil, hurts agriculture and corrodes monuments.
